# Cortex Code Documentation
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

Welcome to the official documentation for **Cortex Code**, the terminal-based user interface (TUI) for the Cortex-OS AI coding agent ecosystem. Cortex Code enables developers to interact with AI agents, monitor GitHub activity, visualize agent-to-agent (A2A) communications, and execute system commandsâ€”all from a high-performance, low-latency terminal environment.

## Current Implementation

Cortex Code is currently implemented as a Rust-based TUI application with the following core features:

- **Interactive AI Chat**: Real-time conversation with AI agents with streaming responses
- **GitHub Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of GitHub activity (PRs, Issues, Analytics)
- **A2A Event Stream**: Live visualization of agent-to-agent communications
- **Command Palette**: Unified interface with 30+ operations
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol server and plugin management
- **Cloudflare Tunnel Integration**: Secure remote access to your development environment

## Future Vision

The roadmap for Cortex Code includes expanding beyond the terminal interface to include:

- **WebUI Foundation**: Browser-based interface with REST API endpoints
- **SDKs**: Python, TypeScript, and other language integrations
- **Enterprise Features**: Advanced security, analytics, and deployment capabilities
- **Extended Integrations**: GitHub Actions, cloud deployment, and more
