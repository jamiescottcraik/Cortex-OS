# Overlay Quickstart
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 MD012 -->

Use overlays to temporarily replace the main interface with focused content
such as the full conversation transcript. This page shows the basic commands
and the output you should expect.

## Open the transcript overlay

From the TUI press `Ctrl+P` to open the command palette and run:

```text
overlay transcript
```

**Expected output:** a full screen view showing the entire chat transcript.

## Close the overlay

Press `q` or `Esc` to exit. The overlay closes and you return to the previous
view.
