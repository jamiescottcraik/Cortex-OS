# RAG TDD Outstanding Work â€“ Actionable Checklist

This checklist captures the remaining, TDD-first work for the RAG package.
Each item includes a testing-first approach, key tasks, and clear Done criteria.

Legend:

- [ ] Not started
- [~] In progress
- [x] Done
- ðŸš¨ Critical for production
- âš¡ Performance/scale blocker
- ðŸ”„ Enhancement/optimization

## Recent Updates (2025-09-20)

- Reliability primitives wired into pipeline edges:
  - Embedded `withRetry` and `CircuitBreaker` around embedder and store calls in `RAGPipeline`.
  - Degraded mode on retrieval: returns empty, safe bundles when breakers are open or failures persist.
  - Added integration tests: retry reduces failures; breaker opens and surfaces degraded path.
- Coverage gates and failure-mode tests:
  - Per-package coverage thresholds (>= 90%) enforced via `vitest` config in `@cortex-os/rag`.
  - Added/validated integration tests for timeouts, degraded mode, and reliability behavior.
- Removed external Archon references from runtime paths; MCP client surface retained as a local, optional shim for remote KB use.
- Ollama updated to v0.12.0 where containerized (Docker compose pinned); docs now recommend Homebrew as the primary install on macOS with Docker as fallback.
- Pg dependency remains optional (`optionalDependencies.pg`), pgvector store uses `@cortex-os/observability` for operation/latency metrics.

## Execution Guidance

### Sprint Planning Recommendations

**Sprint 1 (Week 1-2): Production Blockers**

- Security hardening (highest risk)
- Health checks
- Complete reliability wiring

**Sprint 2 (Week 3-4): Scale Enablers**

- Vector indexing (if >10k docs expected)
- Post-chunking
- Complete observability

**Sprint 3 (Week 5-6): Optimizations**

- Embedding pool
- Workspace scoping (if multi-tenant)
- Deployment documentation

**Future Sprints:**

- Agentic dispatcher
- Alternative backends
- Performance optimizations

### Development Principles

- **TDD loop per item:** Write failing test â†’ minimal implementation â†’ refactor
- **Small, focused diffs:** Add tests and implementation in same commit
- **Feature flags:** Use for risky changes; document rollout/rollback
- **Performance gates:** Establish baseline, detect regressions
- **Security-first:** Every external input must be validated
- **Observability-driven:** If it moves, measure it

### Risk Mitigation

- **Security:** Run OWASP checks in CI, penetration test before launch
- **Performance:** Load test at 2x expected scale
- **Reliability:** Chaos engineering tests in staging
- **Data:** Backup strategy from day 1
- **Monitoring:** Alerts before customers notice issues
