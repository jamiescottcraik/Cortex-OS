## Recent Updates (2025-09-20)

- Reliability primitives wired into pipeline edges:
  - Embedded `withRetry` and `CircuitBreaker` around embedder and store calls in `RAGPipeline`.
  - Degraded mode on retrieval: returns empty, safe bundles when breakers are open or failures persist.
  - Added integration tests: retry reduces failures; breaker opens and surfaces degraded path.
- Coverage gates and failure-mode tests:
  - Per-package coverage thresholds (>= 90%) enforced via `vitest` config in `@cortex-os/rag`.
  - Added/validated integration tests for timeouts, degraded mode, and reliability behavior.
- Removed external Archon references from runtime paths; MCP client surface retained as a local, optional shim for remote KB use.
- Ollama updated to v0.12.0 where containerized (Docker compose pinned); docs now recommend Homebrew as the
  primary install on macOS with Docker as fallback.
- Pg dependency remains optional (`optionalDependencies.pg`), pgvector store uses `@cortex-os/observability` for operation/latency metrics.

- Health server and component checks:
  - Added minimal HTTP server exposing `/live`, `/ready`, `/health` via `createHealthServer` and `HealthProvider`.
  - New bootstrap `startRagHealthServer` wires real components + extraChecks (embedder, pgvector, reranker) and starts server.
  - Component health-check factories added: `createEmbedderHealthCheck`, `createPgvectorHealthCheck`, `createRerankerHealthCheck` with tests.
  - K8s probe examples documented in `health-server.ts`.

- Observability expansion:
  - Reranker latency and success/error metrics recorded in `lib/rerank-docs.ts`.
  - Embedding batch sizes and total chunk characters recorded in `rag-pipeline.ts`.
  - MIME policy cache hit/miss metrics recorded in `policy/mime.ts`.

- Security hardening and validation:
  - Added embedding dimension and content size validation to `RAGPipeline` with configurable defaults.
  - Command injection protection for Python reranker executable paths via `isSafeExecutablePath`.
  - Prototype pollution prevention in metadata sanitization (`lib/validation.ts`).
  - Content security policy for XSS/injection protection (`lib/content-security.ts`) with comprehensive sanitization.
  - Security config options: `allowedEmbeddingDims` (default: [384,768,1024,1536,3072]), `maxContentChars` (default: 25000).
  - Comprehensive validation test coverage for oversized content, invalid embedding dims, and security boundaries.
  - Content security integration tests covering ingestion, retrieval, and configuration scenarios.

- Rate limiting and performance controls:
  - Token bucket rate limiter utility (`lib/rate-limiter.ts`) with capacity/refill controls and testing.
  - Optional rate limiting integration in `rerankDocs` with graceful fallback to original ranking.
  - Test coverage for burst handling, token refill, and capacity capping behaviors.

- Timeout configuration and backpressure handling:
  - Comprehensive timeout configuration per component via `ComponentTimeoutConfig` (`lib/backpressure.ts`).
  - Timeout wrapper utilities: `withTimeout` and `withAbortableTimeout` for operation cancellation.
  - Backpressure management with semaphores, concurrent operation limits, and queue size controls.
  - Resource monitoring for adaptive backpressure based on memory and CPU usage.
  - Centralized reliability configuration (`lib/reliability-config.ts`) with production, development, and test presets.
  - Integration of timeout controls into reranker operations with configurable limits.
  - Comprehensive test coverage for semaphore behavior, timeout handling, resource monitoring, and configuration management.

  Remaining priorities:
  - Security:
    - Add command injection tests for additional subprocess boundaries
    - Expand strict schema validation coverage across tools and configs
    - Implement per-workspace rate limiting middleware
  - Observability:
    - Add ingest throughput and latency counters
    - Add rerank score distribution metrics
    - Publish initial dashboard and SLO specs

## Execution Guidance

### Sprint Planning Recommendations

#### Sprint 1 (Week 1-2): Production Blockers

- Security hardening (highest risk)
- Health checks
- Complete reliability wiring

#### Sprint 2 (Week 3-4): Scale Enablers

- Vector indexing (if >10k docs expected)
- Post-chunking
- Complete observability

#### Sprint 3 (Week 5-6): Optimizations

- Embedding pool
- Workspace scoping (if multi-tenant)
- Deployment documentation

**Future Sprints:**

- Agentic dispatcher
- Alternative backends
- Performance optimizations

### Development Principles

- **TDD loop per item:** Write failing test â†’ minimal implementation â†’ refactor
- **Small, focused diffs:** Add tests and implementation in same commit
- **Feature flags:** Use for risky changes; document rollout/rollback
- **Performance gates:** Establish baseline, detect regressions
- **Security-first:** Every external input must be validated
- **Observability-driven:** If it moves, measure it

### Risk Mitigation

- **Security:** Run OWASP checks in CI, penetration test before launch
- **Performance:** Load test at 2x expected scale
- **Reliability:** Chaos engineering tests in staging
- **Data:** Backup strategy from day 1
- **Monitoring:** Alerts before customers notice issues
