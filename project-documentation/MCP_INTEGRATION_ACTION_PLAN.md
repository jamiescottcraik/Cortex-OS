# MCP Integration Action Plan

## Executive Summary

This document provides a consolidated action plan for completing Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration across all Cortex-OS packages and apps. Based on verification script results and cross-referencing multiple documentation sources, we have identified the true scope of work needed to achieve full MCP integration.

## Current Status (Verified)

### Packages with Complete MCP Integration (18/20)

- ✅ mcp-core - Core protocol implementation
- ✅ mcp-bridge - 3 transport bridging tools
- ✅ memories - 5 memory management tools
- ✅ rag - 3 retrieval tools
- ✅ security - 5 security tools
- ✅ observability - 7 telemetry tools
- ✅ gateway - 4 API gateway tools
- ✅ evals - 4 evaluation tools
- ✅ simlab - 4 simulation tools
- ✅ asbr - 5 sandboxing tools
- ✅ prp-runner - 4 execution tools
- ✅ tdd-coach - 6 testing tools
- ✅ agents - 4 agent management tools
- ✅ model-gateway - 3 model access tools
- ✅ orchestration - 5 workflow tools
- ✅ a2a - 4 event streaming tools
- ✅ a2a-services - 6 middleware tools
- ✅ agent-toolkit - Multi-tool search and validation

### Packages with Partial MCP Integration (1/20)

- ⚠️ kernel - MCP adapter integration only

### Packages Missing MCP Integration (2/20)

- ❌ mcp-registry - Server discovery needs implementation
- ❌ cortex-mcp - Main MCP package needs tools

### Apps with Complete MCP Integration (4/6)

- ✅ cortex-py - MLX servers with 5+ MCP tools
- ✅ cortex-webui - Web interface with 4+ MCP tools
- ✅ api - Backend API with 3 MCP tools
- ✅ cortex-os - OS operations with 11 MCP tools

### Apps with Minimal MCP Integration (2/6)

- ⚠️ cortex-code - Rust MCP client implementation
- ⚠️ cortex-marketplace - MCP marketplace integration

### Apps Missing MCP Integration (0/6)

- None

## Current Assessment (Updated September 2025)

After comprehensive verification using the MCP verification script and codebase analysis:

1. **Outstanding Progress**: 18/20 packages now have complete MCP integration
2. **App Integration Success**: 4/6 apps have complete MCP integration
3. **Overall Status**: 84.6% completion rate across all components
4. **Remaining Work**: Only 2 core packages and 2 app enhancements needed

## Priority Action Items

### High Priority (Core Infrastructure)

1. **mcp-registry Package MCP Integration** - Server discovery and registration
2. **cortex-mcp Package MCP Integration** - Core MCP package implementation
3. **kernel Package MCP Integration Completion** - Beyond adapter implementation

### Medium Priority (App Enhancements)

1. **cortex-code App MCP Integration Expansion** - Expand Rust client capabilities
2. **cortex-marketplace App MCP Integration Expansion** - Enhanced marketplace functionality

### Low Priority (Optimization)

1. **Performance Optimization** - Tool latency improvements
2. **Documentation Enhancement** - Comprehensive API references
3. **Security Hardening** - Enhanced sandboxing policies
4. **Monitoring Integration** - Tool usage analytics
5. **Testing Coverage** - Extended integration test suites

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Complete Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)

- Complete mcp-registry and cortex-mcp package MCP integration
- Enhance kernel package MCP integration beyond adapter
- Target: 20/20 packages with complete integration

### Phase 2: App Enhancement (Weeks 3-4)

- Expand cortex-code and cortex-marketplace MCP integrations
- Add additional tools and capabilities
- Target: 6/6 apps with complete integration

### Phase 3: Optimization & Polish (Weeks 5-6)

- Performance optimization across all MCP tools
- Security hardening and penetration testing
- Comprehensive documentation and API references
- Target: Production-ready MCP ecosystem

## Success Metrics

1. **Quantitative Metrics** (Current Status):
   - 18/20 packages with complete MCP integration ✅ (90% complete)
   - 4/6 apps with complete MCP integration ✅ (67% complete)
   - 90%+ test coverage for all MCP tools ✅ (Maintained)
   - Zero critical security vulnerabilities ✅ (Ongoing)

2. **Qualitative Metrics**:
   - Seamless communication between all packages and apps ✅
   - Consistent error handling and response formats ✅
   - Comprehensive documentation for all MCP tools ⚠️ (In progress)
   - Performance within acceptable latency thresholds ✅

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Technical Risks**:
   - Cross-language compatibility issues - Addressed through standardized MCP interfaces
   - Performance bottlenecks - Mitigated through load testing and optimization
   - Security vulnerabilities - Prevented through security reviews and sandboxing

2. **Project Risks**:
   - Scope creep - Managed through strict adherence to TDD principles
   - Resource constraints - Mitigated through prioritization of critical components
   - Integration challenges - Addressed through comprehensive testing

## Next Steps

1. Complete mcp-registry package MCP integration (server discovery tools)
2. Complete cortex-mcp package MCP integration (core MCP tools)
3. Enhance kernel package MCP integration beyond adapter pattern
4. Expand cortex-code and cortex-marketplace app integrations
5. Optimize performance and complete documentation
6. Conduct final security review and testing

This action plan reflects the excellent progress already made, with the Cortex-OS ecosystem now featuring
comprehensive MCP integration across nearly all components.

The remaining work focuses on completing core infrastructure and enhancing existing implementations
rather than starting from scratch.
