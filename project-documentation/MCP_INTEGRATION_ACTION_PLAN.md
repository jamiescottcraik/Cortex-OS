# MCP Integration Action Plan

## Executive Summary

This document provides a consolidated action plan for completing Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration across all Cortex-OS packages and apps. Based on verification script results and cross-referencing multiple documentation sources, we have identified the true scope of work needed to achieve full MCP integration.

## Current Status (Verified)

### Packages with Complete MCP Integration (15/20)

- ✅ mcp-core
- ✅ memories
- ✅ rag
- ✅ security
- ✅ observability
- ✅ gateway
- ✅ evals
- ✅ simlab
- ✅ asbr
- ✅ prp-runner
- ✅ tdd-coach
- ✅ agents
- ✅ model-gateway
- ✅ a2a (incorrectly marked - actually missing)
- ✅ a2a-services (incorrectly marked - actually missing)

### Packages with Partial MCP Integration (2/20)

- ⚠️ kernel
- ⚠️ orchestration

### Packages Missing MCP Integration (5/20)

- ❌ mcp-bridge
- ❌ mcp-registry
- ❌ cortex-mcp
- ❌ a2a (correctly identified as missing)
- ❌ a2a-services (correctly identified as missing)

### Apps with Complete MCP Integration (0/6)

- None

### Apps with Minimal MCP Integration (3/6)

- ⚠️ cortex-code
- ⚠️ cortex-marketplace
- ⚠️ cortex-os

### Apps Missing MCP Integration (3/6)

- ❌ cortex-py
- ❌ cortex-webui
- ❌ api

## Corrected Assessment

The user was correct in pointing out that there are more packages missing implementation than initially identified. The verification script and documentation cross-reference revealed:

1. **a2a** and **a2a-services** packages were incorrectly marked as having MCP integration in some documentation sources
2. The actual count of packages missing MCP integration is 5, not 3 as initially reported
3. No apps currently have complete MCP integration

## Priority Action Items

### Critical Priority (Must be addressed first)

1. **a2a Package MCP Integration** - Essential for agent-to-agent communication
2. **a2a-services Package MCP Integration** - Critical for service discovery and registry
3. **cortex-py App MCP Integration** - Key for Python-based ML services
4. **cortex-webui App MCP Integration** - Essential for user interface functionality
5. **api App MCP Integration** - Fundamental for backend services

### High Priority (Next to be addressed)

1. **mcp-bridge Package MCP Integration** - Needed for transport bridging
2. **mcp-registry Package MCP Integration** - Required for service discovery
3. **cortex-mcp Package MCP Integration** - Core MCP package implementation
4. **kernel Package MCP Integration Completion** - System-level operations
5. **orchestration Package MCP Integration Completion** - Workflow management

### Medium Priority (Follow-up work)

1. **cortex-code App MCP Integration Expansion** - Rust-based tools
2. **cortex-marketplace App MCP Integration Expansion** - Marketplace functionality
3. **cortex-os App MCP Integration Expansion** - OS-level operations
4. **A2A Event Streaming Implementation** - Real-time communication
5. **A2A Outbox Integration** - Task processing and synchronization

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)

- Complete a2a and a2a-services package MCP integration
- Implement cortex-py, cortex-webui, and api app MCP integration
- Target: 5 packages with complete integration, 3 apps with complete integration

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 4-5)

- Complete mcp-bridge, mcp-registry, and cortex-mcp integration
- Complete kernel and orchestration package integration
- Target: 10 packages with complete integration, 3 apps with complete integration

### Phase 3: Expansion (Weeks 6-7)

- Expand minimal implementations in cortex-code, cortex-marketplace, and cortex-os
- Complete A2A package enhancements
- Target: 10 packages with complete integration, 5 apps with complete integration

### Phase 4: Verification (Week 8)

- End-to-end testing across all components
- Performance optimization
- Security review
- Documentation completion
- Target: 100% MCP integration across all components

## Success Metrics

1. **Quantitative Metrics**:
   - 20/20 packages with complete MCP integration
   - 6/6 apps with complete MCP integration
   - 90%+ test coverage for all MCP tools
   - Zero critical security vulnerabilities

2. **Qualitative Metrics**:
   - Seamless communication between all packages and apps
   - Consistent error handling and response formats
   - Comprehensive documentation for all MCP tools
   - Performance within acceptable latency thresholds

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Technical Risks**:
   - Cross-language compatibility issues - Addressed through standardized MCP interfaces
   - Performance bottlenecks - Mitigated through load testing and optimization
   - Security vulnerabilities - Prevented through security reviews and sandboxing

2. **Project Risks**:
   - Scope creep - Managed through strict adherence to TDD principles
   - Resource constraints - Mitigated through prioritization of critical components
   - Integration challenges - Addressed through comprehensive testing

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of Phase 1 tasks immediately
2. Assign dedicated resources to critical priority items
3. Establish daily standups to track progress
4. Set up continuous integration for MCP tool testing
5. Schedule weekly reviews to assess progress against milestones

This action plan provides a clear roadmap for achieving complete MCP integration across all Cortex-OS components, addressing the user's concerns about missing implementations and ensuring production-ready status across Python, Rust, and TypeScript languages.
