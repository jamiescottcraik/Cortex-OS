### Current State → Target State

| Component | Current | Target | Priority |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------|
| **A2A Messaging** | ❌ 31 errors | ✅ 100% functional | 🔴 P1 |
| **TypeScript Build** | ❌ Cannot compile | ✅ Zero errors | 🔴 P1 |
| **Docker Infrastructure** | ❌ Config broken | ✅ Full stack | 🟡 P2 |
| **Cortex-OS Runtime** | ❌ Won't start | ✅ Second brain | 🟡 P2 |
| **Rust CLI/MCP** | ❌ Missing entirely | ✅ Full tooling | 🟢 P3 |

- [ ] **Docker Gate:** All services healthy within 2 minutes of `docker compose up`

### Week 2 Gates  

- [ ] **Runtime Gate:** `curl http://localhost:7439/health` returns healthy status
- [ ] **Second Brain Gate:** Knowledge storage and retrieval functional
- [ ] **Integration Gate:** A2A messaging working cross-service

### Week 3 Gates

- [ ] **CLI Gate:** `cortex status` shows system information
- [ ] **MCP Gate:** MCP server processes tool requests successfully
- [ ] **Rust Integration Gate:** TypeScript-Rust communication working

### Week 4 Gates

- [ ] **Performance Gate:** >1000 messages/second A2A throughput
- [ ] **Security Gate:** Zero critical vulnerabilities in scans
- [ ] **Production Gate:** 90%+ readiness across all components

## 🛠️ Daily Implementation Commands

### Week 1 Commands

```bash
# Day 1-3: A2A Messaging
cd /Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS
pnpm typecheck packages/a2a/a2a-core  # Should fail initially
# Fix implementations per TDD plan
pnpm typecheck packages/a2a/a2a-core  # Should succeed

# Day 4-5: TypeScript Compilation  
pnpm typecheck:smart  # Should succeed after fixes

docker compose up -d           # All services healthy
```

### Week 2 Commands

```bash
# Day 8-10: Cortex-OS Runtime

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

1. **A2A Messaging Complexity**
   - **Risk:** Breaking existing integrations
   - **Mitigation:** Adapter pattern, progressive rollout, extensive testing

2. **Docker Service Dependencies**
   - **Risk:** Services fail to start in correct order
   - **Mitigation:** Health checks, proper depends_on, timeout handling

3. **Rust-TypeScript Integration**
   - **Risk:** Communication protocol failures
   - **Mitigation:** Robust error handling, fallback mechanisms, IPC testing

### Contingency Plans

- **If A2A fixes take >3 days:** Focus on simplified envelope contract
- **If Docker issues persist:** Use minimal service set for MVP deployment
- **If Rust rebuild is complex:** Prioritize essential CLI functions only
