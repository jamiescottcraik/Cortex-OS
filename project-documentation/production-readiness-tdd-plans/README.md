**Deploy cortex-os as functional second brain** - Core runtime and service orchestration.

- Runtime service wiring and dependency injection
- HTTP server and MCP server implementation
- Knowledge management and agent orchestration
- **Timeline:** 5-7 days | **Depends on:** A2A messaging fixes

### **03-DOCKER-ORCHESTRATION-TDD-PLAN.md** 🟡 **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Production container infrastructure** - Multi-environment deployment with full observability.

- Docker compose configuration repair
- Service health checks and networking
- Production overlay with security configurations
- **Timeline:** 4-6 days | **Enables:** Production deployment

### **04-TYPESCRIPT-COMPILATION-TDD-PLAN.md** 🔴 **IMMEDIATE**

**Zero compilation errors across codebase** - Systematic interface contract fixes.

- Envelope adapter pattern implementation
- Progressive error resolution strategy
- Type safety integration testing
- **Timeline:** 2-3 days | **Blocks:** All TypeScript development

### **05-RUST-CORTEX-CODE-TDD-PLAN.md** 🟢 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Restore Rust CLI and MCP server** - Missing Cargo.toml and complete tooling infrastructure.

- Cargo workspace structure recovery
- CLI tools and TUI interface implementation  
- MCP server with TypeScript integration
- **Timeline:** 5-7 days | **Adds:** Advanced tooling capabilities

### **06-IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md** 📋 **COORDINATION**

**Master implementation timeline** coordinating all plans with dependencies, gates, and success criteria.

- 3-4 week timeline with weekly gates
- Risk mitigation and contingency planning
- Daily implementation commands and validation

---

## 🚦 Implementation Order

### **Phase 1: Critical Blockers (Week 1)**

1. Execute **A2A Messaging TDD Plan** (Days 1-3)
2. Execute **TypeScript Compilation TDD Plan** (Days 4-5)
3. Execute **Docker Orchestration TDD Plan** (Days 6-7)

### **Phase 2: Application Deployment (Week 2)**

1. Execute **Cortex-OS Deployment TDD Plan** (Days 8-14)

### **Phase 3: Advanced Tooling (Week 3)**  

1. Execute **Rust Cortex-Code TDD Plan** (Days 15-21)

### **Phase 4: Production Readiness (Week 4)**

1. Integration testing and production validation (Days 22-28)

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### **90% Production Readiness Gate**

- [ ] **Zero compilation errors** across entire codebase
- [ ] **Docker compose up** succeeds with all services healthy
- [ ] **Cortex-OS runtime** starts and responds to health checks
- [ ] **Second brain functionality** operational (knowledge storage/retrieval)
- [ ] **A2A messaging** reliable with >1000 messages/second throughput
- [ ] **CLI tools** functional for system administration
- [ ] **Security scanning** shows zero critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] **95%+ test coverage** for critical components

### **Deployment Validation Command**

```bash
# Final readiness check
cd /Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS
bash scripts/production-readiness-validation.sh

# Expected output:
# ✅ TypeScript compilation: PASS
# ✅ Full build: PASS  
# ✅ All services healthy: PASS
# ✅ Second brain functionality: PASS
# ✅ CLI tools: PASS
# 🎉 PRODUCTION READINESS: 90%+ ACHIEVED
```

## 📋 Usage Instructions

### **For Implementation Teams**

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Critical blockers must be resolved first
2. **Follow TDD methodology** - Red → Green → Refactor for each plan
3. **Validate gates** - Each plan has specific success criteria
4. **Use parallel execution** - Rust development can start after Week 1

### **For Project Management**

1. **Track weekly gates** - Use roadmap timeline for progress monitoring
2. **Monitor dependencies** - A2A fixes unblock all downstream work
3. **Resource allocation** - 2-3 developers can work in parallel after Week 1
4. **Risk management** - Refer to contingency plans in roadmap

### **For Operations Teams**

1. **Environment preparation** - Docker infrastructure requirements
2. **Monitoring setup** - Prometheus/Grafana dashboard deployment
3. **Security compliance** - Vulnerability scanning integration
4. **Deployment procedures** - Production deployment validation

## 🔧 Quick Start Commands

### **Prerequisites Check**

```bash
# Verify tooling
node --version  # Should be >=20
pnpm --version  # Should be 10.3.0+
docker --version
cargo --version # For Rust components

# Install dependencies
cd /Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS  
pnpm install
```

### **Start Implementation**

```bash
# Begin with A2A messaging fixes
cd packages/a2a/a2a-core
pnpm typecheck  # Will show 31 errors initially
# Follow 01-A2A-MESSAGING-TDD-PLAN.md for fixes
```

### **Validation Throughout**  

```bash
# After each plan completion
pnpm typecheck:smart  # Should improve progressively
pnpm test:smart       # Should pass more tests
docker compose config # Should eventually succeed
```

## 📞 Support & Escalation

### **Technical Questions**

- Refer to specific TDD plan for detailed implementation guidance
- Each plan includes troubleshooting and risk mitigation sections

### **Blocker Escalation**

- **Critical Path Issues:** A2A messaging or TypeScript compilation failures
- **Infrastructure Issues:** Docker configuration or service startup problems
- **Integration Issues:** Cross-service communication or contract violations
