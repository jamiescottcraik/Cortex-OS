# A2A Native Communication and MCP Bridge Setup Plan

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive plan for setting up both the native A2A communication system and the MCP bridge. The plan addresses the user's request to establish both communication methods as complementary systems.

## Current Status Assessment

### A2A Native Communication System ✅

The A2A packages have a fully implemented native communication system based on:

- **CloudEvents 1.0** specification for message format
- **Multiple transport mechanisms** (in-process, file system queue, stdio)
- **Event-driven architecture** with publish/subscribe patterns
- **Built-in features** like idempotency, tracing, and schema validation

### A2A MCP Integration ✅

The A2A packages have implemented MCP tool adapters that bridge to the native A2A functionality:

- **a2a_queue_message** tool for task queuing
- **a2a_event_stream_subscribe** tool for event subscription
- **a2a_outbox_sync** tool for outbox operations
