# MCP TDD Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the Test-Driven Development approach to implementing full Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration across active Cortex-OS apps and packages.

### Operational Notes

- When run via HTTP/SSE, FastMCP may wrap the app; use `health_check` tool if `GET /health` is not exposed in a given mode.
- If `uv run` fails with "No module named encodings", prefer a clean venv rather than mixing tool-managed interpreters.

## Active App Implementations

### cortex-os App MCP Integration

The cortex-os app provides comprehensive MCP integration with system-level operations and orchestration tools.

- **Schema Introspection**: `/api/v1/mcp/tools/{toolName}/schema` endpoint for tool discovery
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schema validation for all tool parameters
- **Error Handling**: Proper MCP error response format with detailed error information
- **Alias Support**: Tools callable by multiple user-friendly names
- **REST Integration**: Seamless bridge between existing REST endpoints and MCP tools

### Status Transformation

**Before**: ⚠️ Minimal MCP integration  
**After**: ✅ Complete MCP integration with 4 fully functional tools and comprehensive error handling

````he implementation follows strict software engineering principles with a focus on ensuring all components support their respective language types (Python, TypeScript, Rust).

## Task 3.4: cortex-mcp – Main MCP Tools (Implemented)

Scope: Implemented primary MCP tools and ensured they are discoverable via FastMCP inspector and usable across transports.

### Delivered Tools (Python server)

- `search(query: str, max_results: int = 10)` — Find Cortex-OS docs/content
- `fetch(resource_id: str)` — Retrieve full content for a resource
- `ping(transport?: str)` — Basic status with transport echo
- `health_check()` — Minimal health probe returning `{status, version}`
- `list_capabilities()` — Enumerates tools/resources/prompts and version

Notes:

- An HTTP `GET /health` route is conditionally exposed when the FastAPI app instance is available.
  Otherwise, use the `health_check` tool for programmatic liveness.

### TDD Evidence

Validated via focused tests in `packages/cortex-mcp`:

- `test_fastmcp_server.py` — importability, server instructions, idempotent creation, CLI globals
- `test_health_endpoint.py` — `health_check` tool and optional `/health` route
- `test_inspector_interaction.py` — round-trip `search`→`fetch` and capability listing

All above tests pass locally with a minimal FastMCP stub when the `fastmcp` package is absent; full runtime verified with `fastmcp` installed.

### How to Run (Transports)

1. Create venv and install transports (recommended):

```zsh
python3.11 -m venv .venv311
./.venv311/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
./.venv311/bin/pip install fastmcp fastapi 'uvicorn[standard]' websockets httpx
```

1. Launch server:

```zsh
HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=3024 TRANSPORT=http \
./.venv311/bin/python packages/mcp/cortex_fastmcp_server_v2.py
```

1. Inspector / capabilities:

```zsh
fastmcp inspect packages/mcp/cortex_fastmcp_server_v2.py --format mcp
fastmcp dev packages/mcp/cortex_fastmcp_server_v2.py
```

1. Alternative transports:

```zsh
fastmcp run packages/mcp/cortex_fastmcp_server_v2.py --transport stdio
fastmcp run packages/mcp/cortex_fastmcp_server_v2.py --transport http --port 3024
fastmcp run packages/mcp/cortex_fastmcp_server_v2.py --transport sse --port 3024
```

### Operational Notes

- When run via HTTP/SSE, FastMCP may wrap the app; use `health_check` tool if `GET /health` is not exposed in a given mode.
- If `uv run` fails with “No module named encodings”, prefer a clean venv rather than mixing tool-managed interpreters.
