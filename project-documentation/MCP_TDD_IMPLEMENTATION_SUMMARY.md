# MCP TDD Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the Test-Driven Development approach to implementing full Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration across all Cortex-OS apps and packages. The implementation follows strict software engineering principles with a focus on ensuring all components support their respective language types (Python, TypeScript, Rust).

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation and Planning ✅

- [ ] Establish MCP integration patterns for Python, TypeScript, and Rust
- [ ] Define MCP interface contracts and schemas
- [ ] Set up testing infrastructure for MCP integrations

### Phase 2: Core Package Integration ⏳

- [ ] memories Package MCP Integration
- [ ] rag Package MCP Integration
- [ ] security Package MCP Integration
- [ ] observability Package MCP Integration
- [ ] a2a Package MCP Integration
- [ ] a2a-services Package MCP Integration
- [ ] gateway Package MCP Integration
- [ ] evals Package MCP Integration
- [ ] simlab Package MCP Integration
- [ ] orchestration Package MCP Integration

### Phase 3: App Integration ⏳

- [ ] cortex-py App MCP Integration
- [ ] cortex-webui App MCP Integration
- [ ] api App MCP Integration

### Phase 4: Verification and Refinement ⏳

- [ ] End-to-end testing of all MCP integrations
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security review
- [ ] Documentation completion
