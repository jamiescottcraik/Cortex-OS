# MCP Integration Tracker

This document tracks the MCP integration status across all Cortex-OS packages and apps, providing real-time progress updates.

## Detailed Progress by Component Type

### Core Packages (7)

- Complete: 1 (14.3%)
- Partial/Minimal: 3 (42.9%)
- Not Started: 3 (42.9%)

### Service Packages (10)

- Complete: 9 (90%)
- Partial/Minimal: 1 (10%)

## Next Steps

1. Complete MCP integration for packages with partial implementation:
   - mcp-core (needs tools implementation)
   - mcp-bridge (Task 3.2)
   - mcp-registry (Task 3.3)
   - cortex-mcp (Task 3.4)
   - kernel (expand implementation)
   - orchestration (Task 2.5)
   - a2a (Task 2.6)
   - a2a-services (Task 2.7)

2. Implement MCP integration for apps with no implementation:
   - cortex-py (Task 2.11)
   - cortex-webui (Task 2.12)
   - api (Task 2.13)

3. Expand minimal MCP implementations:
   - cortex-code (expand Rust MCP client)
   - cortex-marketplace (expand marketplace integration)
   - cortex-os (Task 2.10 - expand implementation)
