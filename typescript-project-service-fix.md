# TypeScript Project Service Fix Summary

## Problem
The TypeScript project service was unable to find these test files:
1. `/Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/src/lib/mlx/__tests__/embed.test.ts`
2. `/Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/src/lib/mlx/__tests__/rerank.test.ts`
3. `/Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/tests/auth/auth-flows.spec.ts`

## Root Cause
The main `tsconfig.json` file was excluding test files (lines 257-258), but there was no proper project reference to a test configuration that would include them.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Import Issues
- Updated `src/lib/mlx/embed.ts` to use `import * as path from 'node:path'` instead of `import path from 'node:path'`
- Updated `src/lib/mlx/rerank.ts` to use `import * as path from 'node:path'` instead of `import path from 'node:path'`
- Replaced unused `@ts-expect-error` directive with appropriate eslint disable comments

### 2. Created Limited Test Configuration
- Created `tsconfig.limited-test.json` that specifically includes:
  - `src/lib/mlx/**/*`
  - `tests/auth/**/*`
  - `simple-tests/**/*`
  - Vitest config files

### 3. Enhanced VS Code Settings
- Added file system watching options for better file detection
- Enabled project diagnostics
- Added preference for type-only auto imports

## Verification
After the fixes:
- ✅ `src/lib/mlx/__tests__/embed.test.ts` compiles successfully
- ✅ `src/lib/mlx/__tests__/rerank.test.ts` compiles successfully
- ✅ `tests/auth/auth-flows.spec.ts` is found by TypeScript service (only missing @playwright/test dependency)

## Files Modified
1. `/Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/src/lib/mlx/embed.ts` - Fixed import statement
2. `/Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/src/lib/mlx/rerank.ts` - Fixed import statement
3. `/Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/.vscode/settings.json` - Enhanced TypeScript settings
4. `/Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/tsconfig.limited-test.json` - Created new test configuration

The TypeScript project service can now properly find and parse all the previously missing test files.
