# Cortex Docs

Welcome to **Cortex-OS** - an Autonomous Software-Based Reasoning (ASBR) platform that enables intelligent agents to reason, plan, and execute complex tasks autonomously.

This site uses **Docusaurus**, defaults to **dark mode**, and routes docs at `/` (docs-as-homepage).

## What is ASBR?

Autonomous Software-Based Reasoning represents a new paradigm in AI where software agents can:

- **Reason** about complex problems using advanced language models
- **Plan** multi-step solutions with error handling and recovery
- **Execute** tasks through coordinated agent interactions
- **Learn** from experience and adapt to new scenarios

## Key Features
