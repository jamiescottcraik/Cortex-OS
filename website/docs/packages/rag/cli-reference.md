# CLI Reference

The RAG package currently ships as a library and does not expose a standalone CLI.

## Available Scripts
Run from `packages/rag`:

```bash
pnpm build          # Compile TypeScript
pnpm test           # Run unit tests
pnpm docs:verify    # Ensure docs are up to date
```

A dedicated `rag` command-line tool is planned to support ingestion jobs and diagnostics.
