# Introduction

The A2A package delivers an event-driven communication framework for Cortex-OS agents. It standardizes messaging with CloudEvents 1.0 and propagates distributed tracing through W3C Trace Context. By providing a type-safe bus and transport abstraction, A2A solves coordination and observability challenges in multi-agent environments.
