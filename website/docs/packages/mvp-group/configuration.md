# Configuration

MVP Group operates without a dedicated config file. Runtime behavior is adjusted via the `RunOptions` object passed to `runPRPWorkflow`:

- `runId` - override the autogenerated run identifier
- `deterministic` - force deterministic IDs and timestamps
- `id` - attach a custom blueprint identifier
