# Best Practices

- Use representative **golden datasets** that mirror production usage.
- Set **thresholds** slightly above current performance to drive improvement.
- Fail fast in CI and surface `SuiteOutcome.notes` for diagnostics.
- Version control your configuration to track changes over time.
