# CLI Reference

A dedicated command line interface is not yet provided. Planned tooling will offer:

- `evals run &lt;config&gt;` - execute suites defined in a config file.
- `evals list` - list available suites and their options.

For now, invoke the library programmatically as described in the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) guide.
