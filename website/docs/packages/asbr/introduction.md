# Introduction

The Agentic Second-Brain Runtime (ASBR) orchestrates brain-only agents on a single host. It exposes a minimal HTTP API, an ergonomic SDK, and accessibility-aware tooling to build local-first automation.

ASBR solves the need for secure, repeatable task execution without cloud dependencies, making it ideal for privacy-sensitive environments.
