# Providers Setup

Configure external providers through environment variables:

| Provider | Env Vars |
| --- | --- |
| Model Gateway | `MODEL_GATEWAY_URL`, authentication headers |
| Memory Store | `LOCAL_MEMORY_BASE_URL`, `LOCAL_MEMORY_API_KEY` |

Ensure variables are exported before launching the runtime.
