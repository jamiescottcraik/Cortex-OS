# Best Practices

- Commit tests and implementation together to maintain TDD flow.
- Keep configurations minimal and explicit.
- Run in `--watch` mode during active development.
- Use `LOCAL_MEMORY_BASE_URL` to persist coaching across sessions.
- Review coaching feedback before overriding any warnings.
