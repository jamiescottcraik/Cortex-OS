# Best Practices

- Enable privacy mode in regulated environments to restrict remote provider access.
- Pin explicit model names to guarantee deterministic behaviour.
- Monitor `/metrics` and audit logs to detect misuse.
- Store provider credentials in environment variables, never in source control.
