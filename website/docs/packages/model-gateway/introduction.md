# Introduction

Model Gateway provides a unified HTTP interface for text generation, embeddings, and reranking across local and remote model providers. It prioritizes Apple MLX models for on-device performance while falling back to providers such as Ollama or MCP when local models are unavailable. Centralized policy enforcement and privacy controls make it suitable for regulated environments.
