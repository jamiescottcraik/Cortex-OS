# Introduction

Cortex WebUI delivers a responsive interface for interacting with AI models. It unifies chat, file handling, and real-time updates into a single web application aimed at developers and operators.

The project solves the problem of managing conversational AI sessions and related assets without relying on proprietary frontends. It exposes both REST and WebSocket APIs so other services and tools can integrate seamlessly.
