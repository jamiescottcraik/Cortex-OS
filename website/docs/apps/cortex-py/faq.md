# FAQ

**Why do embeddings fail to generate?**
Check that MLX dependencies are installed and the model path is valid.

**How do I speed up tests?**
Use a small local model and set `MLX_LOCAL_MODEL_PATH` to its directory.

**Can I use GPUs?**
MLX targets Apple Silicon; for GPU backends use other services in Cortex-OS.
