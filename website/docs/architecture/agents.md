# Agent Architecture

Learn about the agent system architecture in Cortex-OS.

## Agent Types

Cortex-OS includes several specialized agent types:

### Reasoning Agents

- **Purpose**: Complex problem analysis and solution planning
- **Capabilities**: Multi-step reasoning, context analysis, decision making
- **Use Cases**: Strategic planning, complex problem solving

### Execution Agents

- **Purpose**: Task execution and action coordination
- **Capabilities**: Tool invocation, workflow orchestration, resource management
- **Use Cases**: Code generation, file operations, API interactions

### Memory Agents

- **Purpose**: Information storage and retrieval
- **Capabilities**: Context persistence, knowledge indexing, memory optimization
- **Use Cases**: Long-term context, knowledge base management

## Agent Communication

Agents communicate through the **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** system:

- **Event-driven messaging** for async coordination
- **JSON-RPC 2.0** style message patterns
- **Type-safe contracts** via Zod schemas
- **Observability hooks** for debugging and monitoring

## Agent Lifecycle

1. **Registration** - Agent registers with the runtime
2. **Initialization** - Agent sets up capabilities and subscriptions
3. **Execution** - Agent processes events and executes tasks
4. **Coordination** - Agent collaborates with other agents
5. **Cleanup** - Agent releases resources on shutdown
