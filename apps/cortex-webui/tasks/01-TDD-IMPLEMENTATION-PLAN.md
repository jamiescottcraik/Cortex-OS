## Iteration 1: Foundation & Security (Weeks 1-4)

### Iteration 1 Goals
1. Establish TDD infrastructure and CI pipeline
2. Achieve security hardening for Express backend
3. Implement operational readiness monitoring
4. Close critical test gaps in authentication and middleware

### Phase 1.1: TDD Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)

#### Task 1.1.1: Quality Gate Infrastructure
**Behavior**: Quality gates automatically enforce standards on every PR
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `.eng/quality_gate.json` created and validated
- [ ] CI pipeline includes coverage, mutation, security scans
- [ ] PR comments show quality gate results
- [ ] Baseline coverage established (current state)

**Test-First Approach**:
```javascript
// scripts/ci/__tests__/quality-gate-enforcer.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { QualityGateEnforcer } from '../quality-gate-enforcer';

describe('QualityGateEnforcer', () => {
  it('should fail when line coverage below threshold', async () => {
    const enforcer = new QualityGateEnforcer({
      coverage: { line: 95 },
      metrics: { coverage: { line: 85 } }
    });
    
    const result = await enforcer.enforce();
    expect(result.passed).toBe(false);
    expect(result.violations).toContain('Line coverage 85% < required 95%');
  });

  it('should pass when all gates met', async () => {
    const enforcer = new QualityGateEnforcer({
      coverage: { line: 95, branch: 95, mutation_score: 80 },
      metrics: { 
        coverage: { line: 96, branch: 96 },
        mutation: { score: 82 },
        security: { critical: 0, high: 0 }
      }
    });
    
    const result = await enforcer.enforce();
    expect(result.passed).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

**Implementation**: Create `scripts/ci/quality-gate-enforcer.ts` to pass tests

**Files to Create**:
- `scripts/ci/quality-gate-enforcer.ts`
- `scripts/ci/coverage.sh`
- `scripts/ci/mutation.sh`
- `scripts/ci/security-scan.sh`
- `scripts/ci/ops-readiness.sh`
- `.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml`

## Iteration 2: AI Features & Performance (Weeks 5-8)

### Iteration 2 Goals
1. Implement RAG with citations
2. Add multimodal support (image, PDF, audio)
3. Integrate MCP-compatible tool system
4. Achieve performance SLOs under load

### Phase 2.1: RAG Integration (Week 5)

#### Task 2.1.1: Document Indexing and Vector Search
**Behavior**: Uploaded documents indexed for semantic search
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] PDF, DOCX, TXT files parsed and chunked
- [ ] Text embedded using sentence-transformers
- [ ] Vector database (Qdrant/Weaviate) stores embeddings
- [ ] Semantic search returns relevant passages
- [ ] Citations link to source documents and page numbers

---

## Iteration 3: Agentic AI & Production Hardening (Weeks 9-12)

### Iteration 3 Goals
1. Implement agentic workflow engine
2. Add comprehensive E2E tests
3. Achieve 95/95 coverage and 95% ops readiness
4. Production deployment and monitoring

## Implementation Guidelines

### TDD Discipline
1. **RED**: Write failing test first, run it, confirm failure
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass test
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up code while keeping tests green
4. **REPEAT**: Next behavior/edge case

### Code Quality Standards (CODESTYLE.md)
- Functions â‰¤ 40 lines
- Named exports only
- Explicit type annotations
- Async states handled (loading, error, empty, success)
- ARIA roles and keyboard navigation
- No secrets in code

## Conclusion

This TDD plan transforms cortex-webui into a production-ready, AI-enhanced platform following brAInwav standards. By adhering to strict TDD discipline, achieving 95/95 coverage with 80% mutation score, and maintaining 95% operational readiness, the codebase will be robust, maintainable, and ready for enterprise deployment.
