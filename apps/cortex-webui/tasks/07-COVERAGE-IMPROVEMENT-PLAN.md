# Coverage Improvement Plan
## Systematic Path to 95% Coverage

**Current State**: 29.98% line coverage, 63.23% branch coverage
**Target**: 95% line coverage, 95% branch coverage
**Test Files**: 47 files with 1171 test cases
**Date**: October 2, 2025

---

## 🎯 Phase 1: Coverage Audit & Prioritization (Week 1)

### 1.1 Identify Uncovered Critical Paths

High Priority Areas (Critical Business Logic):
- [ ] Authentication middleware (`src/middleware/auth.ts`) - 0% coverage
- [ ] API routes (`src/routes/api/`) - Average 15% coverage
- [ ] Database operations (`src/db/`) - 25% coverage
- [ ] Error handling middleware (`src/middleware/errorHandler.ts`) - 10% coverage

Medium Priority Areas:
- [ ] Utility functions (`src/utils/`) - 40% coverage
- [ ] Service layer (`src/services/`) - 35% coverage
- [ ] Validation schemas (`src/validation/`) - 50% coverage

### 1.2 Coverage Gap Analysis

```bash
# Generate detailed coverage report
pnpm test:coverage --reporter=text > coverage-report.txt

# Identify files with <50% coverage
grep -E "\s+[0-4][0-9]\.[0-9]+%" coverage-report.txt

# Find completely uncovered files
grep -E "\s+0\.[0-9]+%" coverage-report.txt
```

## 🚀 Phase 2: Systematic Coverage Implementation (Weeks 2-6)

### Week 2: Core Authentication & Security
**Target**: +20% line coverage

**Monday**: Auth Middleware
```typescript
// src/__tests__/middleware/auth.test.ts
describe('Authentication Middleware', () => {
  it('should validate JWT tokens correctly')
  it('should handle expired tokens')
  it('should reject invalid tokens')
  it('should pass valid tokens')
  it('should handle missing tokens')
  it('should attach user to request')
  it('should handle auth service errors')
  it('should rate limit auth attempts')
})
```

**Tuesday**: Security Headers
```typescript
// src/__tests__/middleware/security.test.ts
describe('Security Headers', () => {
  it('should set HSTS header')
  it('should set CSP header')
  it('should set X-Frame-Options')
  it('should set X-Content-Type-Options')
  it('should handle CORS properly')
  it('should validate origins')
})
```

**Wednesday-Friday**: Input Validation
- [ ] Test all validation schemas
- [ ] Test sanitization functions
- [ ] Test file upload validation
- [ ] Test API endpoint validation

### Week 3: API Routes & Controllers
**Target**: +15% line coverage

**Priority Routes**:
1. `/api/v1/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints
2. `/api/v1/chat/*` - Chat functionality
3. `/api/v1/documents/*` - Document management
4. `/api/v1/users/*` - User management

**Test Pattern**:
```typescript
describe('API Route: /api/v1/auth/login', () => {
  describe('POST /login', () => {
    it('should authenticate valid credentials')
    it('should reject invalid credentials')
    it('should handle missing fields')
    it('should return JWT token on success')
    it('should handle rate limiting')
    it('should log authentication attempts')
    it('should handle concurrent requests')
  })
})
```

### Week 4: Database Operations
**Target**: +15% line coverage

**Areas to Cover**:
- [ ] Database connection management
- [ ] Transaction handling
- [ ] Query builders
- [ ] Migration scripts
- [ ] Database health checks

### Week 5: Service Layer
**Target**: +10% line coverage

**Critical Services**:
- [ ] Document processing service
- [ ] Vector search service
- [ ] Notification service
- [ ] Cache service
- [ ] Logging service

### Week 6: Error Handling & Edge Cases
**Target**: +10% line coverage

**Focus Areas**:
- [ ] Global error handler
- [ ] Timeout handling
- [ ] Retry logic
- [ ] Circuit breaker patterns
- [ ] Graceful shutdown

---

## 📊 Phase 3: Advanced Coverage (Weeks 7-8)

### Week 7: Integration Testing
**Target**: +5% line coverage

- [ ] End-to-end API flows
- [ ] Database integration tests
- [ ] Third-party service integrations
- [ ] WebSocket connections

### Week 8: Performance & Load Testing
**Target**: Maintain coverage while adding performance tests

- [ ] Load test endpoints
- [ ] Stress test database
- [ ] Memory leak tests
- [ ] Concurrent request handling

---

## 🔧 Implementation Strategy

### Daily Standup Checklist
- [ ] Review yesterday's coverage metrics
- [ ] Identify today's target files
- [ ] Pair program on complex tests
- [ ] Update coverage tracker

### Test Writing Guidelines
1. **RED**: Write failing test first
2. **GREEN**: Minimal implementation to pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up both test and code
4. **REVIEW**: Ensure coverage increases

### Coverage Validation
```bash
# After each test file added
pnpm test:coverage --reporter=text-summary

# Check specific file coverage
pnpm test:coverage src/middleware/auth.ts

# Generate HTML report for detailed view
pnpm test:coverage --reporter=html
```

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Testing only happy paths**
   - Always test error conditions
   - Test edge cases and boundaries
   - Test failure scenarios

2. **Mock overuse**
   - Mock only external dependencies
   - Test real implementations when possible
   - Verify mock behavior matches reality

3. **Coverage without quality**
   - Ensure tests assert meaningful behavior
   - Review test code quality
   - Run mutation testing to validate

### Blocker Resolution
- **Test environment issues**: Use Docker containers
- **Database setup**: Use test fixtures and transactions
- **External dependencies**: Use contract testing
- **Time constraints**: Focus on high-impact areas first
