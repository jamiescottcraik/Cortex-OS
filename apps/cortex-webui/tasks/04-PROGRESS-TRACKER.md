## 🔍 Coverage Gap Analysis

### ✅ RESOLVED: Coverage Configuration Issue

**Root Cause Found**: Backend tests were not included in coverage calculation
- **Issue**: Backend package was missing from vitest workspace configuration
- **Fix**: Added `apps/cortex-webui/backend/vitest.config.ts` to workspace
- **Result**: Tests now properly discovered and can be executed

### Current Test Status
- **Total Tests Created**: 567+ tests
- **Test Files**: 108 total (34 passing, 74 failing)
- **Individual Tests**: 148 total (99 passing, 49 failing)
- **Success Rate**: 66.9% of tests passing

### Remaining Issues
1. **Import Path Issues**: Tests referencing `.js` files instead of `.ts`
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Added `eventsource`, `kysely`
3. **Environment Variables**: Configuration needs proper setup
4. **Test Implementation Failures**: Mock and assertion issues in some tests

### Next Priority
Fix import extensions in test files to use `.ts` instead of `.js`

### Next Steps (Critical)

### Top 10 Files Needing Coverage

| File | Current | Target | Gap | Priority |
|------|---------|--------|-----|----------|
| Total Coverage | 29.98% | 95% | 65.02% | Critical |
| scripts/ci/quality-gate-enforcer.ts | 0% | 95% | 95% | High |
| simple-tests/agent-isolation-sandbox-impl.ts | 0% | 95% | 95% | High |
| libs/typescript/contracts/src/sandbox-audit-events.ts | 0% | 95% | 95% | Medium |

**Action**: Focus on high-impact files first

## 📈 Velocity Tracking

### Test Creation Velocity

```
Week 1:  567+ tests  (significantly above target)
Week 2:  ??? tests
Week 3:  ??? tests
Week 4:  ??? tests

Average: 567+ tests/week
Target:  60 tests/week
```

## 🚨 Active Blockers

### Critical Issues

**🔴 BLOCKER: TypeScript Compilation Errors**
- **Issue**: Multiple TypeScript errors preventing tests from running
- **Impact**: Cannot execute tests or measure coverage
- **Errors**:
  - Property 'user' does not exist on Request type
  - Database adapter issues
  - Missing type declarations
- **Action**: Fix TypeScript errors before proceeding

**🔴 BLOCKER: Test Failures**
- **Issue**: 45 test files failing with various errors
- **Impact**: Cannot achieve coverage targets
- **Examples**:
  - EmbeddingService mock failures
  - AudioTranscriptionService missing functions
  - Input validation logic errors
- **Action**: Fix failing tests systematically

**Status**: Tests cannot run due to compilation errors

**Next Steps**:
1. Fix TypeScript compilation errors
2. Fix failing test implementations
3. Re-run coverage assessment
4. Continue systematic coverage improvement
