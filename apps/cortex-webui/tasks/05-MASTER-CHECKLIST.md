🎯 **Target**: 95/95 coverage, 80% mutation score, 95% ops readiness
⏱️ **Timeline**: 12 weeks
👥 **Team**: 2-3 developers + 1 QA engineer

## 🎯 Current Status (As of October 2, 2025)

### ✅ Major Achievements
- **Test Infrastructure**: Fully configured and working

### 🔴 Current Blockers
1. **Import Path Issues**: Tests referencing `.js` instead of `.ts` files
2. **Environment Variables**: Test environment needs proper configuration
3. **Mock Configurations**: Some tests have incorrect mock setups
4. **Coverage Measurement**: Blocked by failing tests

### 📊 Progress Metrics
- **Overall Progress**: ~25% complete
- **Tests Created**: 567+ (target: 800+)
- **Test Success Rate**: 60.1% (98/163 passing)
- **Coverage**: Still at 29.98% (cannot measure accurately until tests pass)

## 🚀 Quick Start (Day 1)

### Step 1: Review All Planning Documents (2 hours)

- [ ] Read main TDD Implementation Plan
- [ ] Review TDD Planning Guide
- [ ] Review CODESTYLE.md
- [ ] Understand quality gate requirements

### Step 2: Run Bootstrap Script (30 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/apps/cortex-webui

# Run the bootstrap
bash tasks/02-QUICK-START-SCRIPTS.sh

# Verify setup
pnpm install
pnpm test:unit --run
```

### Step 3: Baseline Assessment (1 hour)

```bash
# Generate current coverage report
pnpm test:coverage

# Run ops readiness assessment  
pnpm ops:assess

# Check for security vulnerabilities
pnpm audit --audit-level=high
```

**Record Your Baseline**:
- Current line coverage: _______% 
- Current branch coverage: _______% 
- Ops readiness score: _______/20
- Critical/high vulnerabilities: _______
