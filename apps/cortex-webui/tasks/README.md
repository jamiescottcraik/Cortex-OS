## 🎖️ Success Principles

### The TDD Mantra
1. 🔴 **RED** - Write a failing test
2. 🟢 **GREEN** - Make it pass (minimal code)
3. 🔵 **REFACTOR** - Clean up the code
4. 🔁 **REPEAT** - Next behavior/edge case

### Quality Standards (CODESTYLE.md)
- Functions ≤ 40 lines
- Named exports only
- Explicit type annotations
- No secrets in code
- 95% coverage minimum

### Team Commitments
- ✅ Follow TDD strictly
- ✅ Never skip tests
- ✅ Pair program on complex features
- ✅ Review PRs within 4 hours
- ✅ Celebrate wins together
