## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Week 1)

### Day 1-2: Core Coverage Push
1. **Run coverage report**
   ```bash
   cd apps/cortex-webui/backend
   pnpm test:coverage
   ```

2. **Focus on high-impact files**
   - `src/middleware/` - Auth, security, validation
   - `src/routes/api/` - All API endpoints
   - `src/services/` - Business logic services
   - `src/db/` - Database operations

3. **Write tests following TDD pattern**
   - RED: Write failing test
   - GREEN: Make it pass
   - REFACTOR: Clean up code
   - Repeat

### Day 3-4: Integration Testing
- Test complete user flows
- Database integration tests
- Third-party service mocks
- Error handling scenarios

### Day 5: Review and Adjust
- Review coverage report
- Identify remaining gaps
- Adjust strategy for Week 2
- Update progress tracker

## 🛠 Tools and Automation

### Progress Tracking Script
```bash
# Update progress automatically
./tasks/scripts/update-progress.sh
```

### Coverage Commands
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Check specific file coverage
pnpm test:coverage --reporter=text

# Generate HTML report
pnpm test:coverage --reporter=html
```

### Quality Gates
```bash
# Run quality gate validation
pnpm quality:check

# Security audit
pnpm audit --audit-level=high

# Mutation testing
pnpm test:mutation
```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Daily Routine
1. **Morning**: Check progress tracker
2. **Start**: Pick target file from coverage report
3. **TDD**: Write tests first
4. **Validate**: Run coverage check
5. **Update**: Mark tasks complete
6. **End**: Run progress update script

### Test Writing Guidelines
- Test all error conditions
- Cover edge cases and boundaries
- Mock external dependencies
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests in describe blocks

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Tests written before implementation
- [ ] Coverage increased on target files
- [ ] No TODO comments left
- [ ] Error paths tested
- [ ] Performance considered

## 🚨 Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Coverage Plateau
**Mitigation**: Focus on high-impact files first, use automation to track progress

### Risk 2: Test Quality vs Quantity
**Mitigation**: Run mutation testing to validate test effectiveness

### Risk 3: Timeline Pressure
**Mitigation**: Adjust scope based on critical paths, parallel test writing

### Risk 4: Technical Debt
**Mitigation**: Refactor while writing tests, follow CODESTYLE.md strictly
