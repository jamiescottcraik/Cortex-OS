# Feature Ideas for Cortex Code TUI

This document outlines potential enhancements to the Cortex Code TUI to expand its functionality and improve the developer experience, incorporating features inspired by OpenAI Codex and other AI coding assistants.

## âœ… IMPLEMENTED FEATURES (v2.0)

### 1. Enhanced Slash Command System

The enhanced slash command system has been fully implemented with 13 Codex-style commands:

```rust
// Implemented slash commands
vec![
    ("/explain", "Explain selected code or concept"),
    ("/refactor", "Suggest code improvements for selected code"),
    ("/test", "Generate unit tests for selected code"),
    ("/document", "Create documentation for selected code"),
    ("/find", "Search for code patterns in project"),
    ("/fix", "Suggest bug fixes for error messages"),
    ("/optimize", "Optimize performance of selected code"),
    ("/security", "Scan selected code for vulnerabilities"),
    ("/complexity", "Analyze code complexity metrics"),
    ("/dependencies", "Analyze project dependencies"),
    ("/review", "Perform code review on selected code"),
    ("/suggest", "Get AI suggestions for improving code"),
    ("/debug", "Help debug issues with code"),
]
```

These commands are integrated with the existing MCP system and AI providers to deliver contextual assistance. Implementation completed in [enhanced_input.rs](file:///Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/apps/cortex-code/src/tui/enhanced_input.rs) and [cortex_command_palette.rs](file:///Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/apps/cortex-code/src/view/cortex_command_palette.rs).

### 2. Security Hardening

Critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed:

- **Command Injection (MLX Provider)**: Completely rewritten to use secure `Command::new()` with stdin input
- **Network Binding**: Changed from `0.0.0.0` to secure localhost-only binding with production environment variable support
- **Input Sanitization**: Added comprehensive input validation and sanitization

### 3. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

Full MCP service implementation has been completed:

- **Full MCP Service Implementation**: Created `src/mcp/service.rs` with production-ready bridge to TypeScript MCP core
- **Registry Integration**: Fixed registry to work with server names instead of IDs
- **App Integration**: Updated `CortexApp` to use new `McpService`
- **TDD Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for MCP functionality

### 4. Production Monitoring & Metrics

Full metrics system has been implemented:

- **Full Metrics System**: Created `src/metrics/mod.rs` with comprehensive performance tracking
- **Health Monitoring**: Request metrics, performance metrics, usage metrics, error tracking
- **Production Ready**: Prometheus-compatible metrics, alerting support

### 5. Production Deployment Documentation

Complete deployment guide has been created:

- **Complete Deployment Guide**: `docs/production-deployment.md` with security hardening
- **Systemd Service**: Production-ready service configuration with security constraints
- **High Availability**: Load balancer configuration, monitoring integration
- **Backup & Recovery**: Complete backup/restore procedures

## ðŸš€ PLANNED FEATURES

### 1. Project Context Management

A system for managing project-specific context that would enhance AI responses based on the current project, similar to how Codex understands codebases:

### Project Context Features

- Automatic project detection based on current directory
- Context-aware AI responses based on project tech stack
- Project-specific configuration templates
- Recent project history tracking
- Multi-project workspace management
- Codebase understanding with semantic search
- Cross-file reference tracking

Implementation would involve:

- Directory scanning for project markers (.git, package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.)
- Tech stack detection based on project files
- Context serialization for persistence
- Integration with existing configuration system
- Semantic memory with embedding-based storage

### 2. Enhanced A2A Visualization

Improvements to the Agent-to-Agent event stream to provide better observability:

### Enhanced A2A Features

- Filter by agent type (GitHub, Security, Code Review, etc.)
- Visual connection diagrams showing agent interactions
- Performance metrics for each agent
- Historical event analysis and pattern detection
- Export event logs for offline analysis
- Custom event highlighting rules
- Agent collaboration visualization

This would require enhancements to the [A2aEventStream](file:///Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/apps/cortex-code/src/view/a2a_stream.rs#L26-L26) component and potentially a new visualization widget.

### 3. Local AI Model Management

Enhanced MLX integration for Apple Silicon with a dedicated management interface, similar to Codex's local agent capabilities:

### Local AI Features

- Model download and management interface
- Performance monitoring for local inference
- Memory usage optimization controls
- Model switching interface with benchmarks
- Local model fine-tuning capabilities
- Model version management
- Hybrid cloud/local processing decisions

This would build upon the existing [LocalMLXProvider](file:///Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/apps/cortex-code/src/providers/local.rs#L10-L10) and require a new UI component for model management.

### 4. Team Collaboration Features

Multi-user capabilities for team environments, similar to Codex's collaboration features:

### Collaboration Features

- Shared workspaces with team members
- Real-time collaboration on code reviews
- Activity feeds showing team member actions
- Permission management for different access levels
- Shared command history and favorites
- Team-specific configuration profiles
- Code review collaboration with AI assistance

This would require backend services for coordination and new UI components for collaboration features.

### 5. Customizable Dashboard

Enhanced UI customization options:

### Dashboard Customization

- Widget arrangement and resizing
- Theme customization with color schemes
- Keyboard shortcut remapping
- View layout preferences (horizontal/vertical splits)
- Custom status bar components
- Font and size preferences
- Accessibility options
- Personalized AI assistant settings

This would involve extending the existing configuration system and UI rendering logic.

### 6. Advanced GitHub Integration
