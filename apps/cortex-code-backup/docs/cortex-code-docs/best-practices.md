# Best Practices

This document provides recommendations and guidelines for using Cortex Code effectively, optimizing performance, and maintaining security.

## Overview

Cortex Code is a powerful tool for AI-assisted development, but using it effectively requires understanding best practices for configuration, usage patterns, and workflow integration. This guide covers recommendations for both individual developers and teams.

## Configuration Best Practices

### Provider Configuration

#### Selecting the Right Provider

Choose AI providers based on your needs:

- **GitHub Models**: Best for getting started (free tier with rate limits)
- **OpenAI**: Best for advanced reasoning and complex tasks
- **Anthropic**: Best for detailed analysis and explanation
- **MLX**: Best for local development on Apple Silicon (no internet required)

Example multi-provider configuration:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "default": "github",
    "fallback": ["openai", "anthropic"],
    "config": {
      "github": {
        "models": ["gpt-4o-mini", "gpt-4o"],
        "rate_limits": {
          "requests_per_minute": 60
        }
      },
      "openai": {
        "models": ["gpt-4-turbo", "gpt-3.5-turbo"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Rate Limit Management

Configure appropriate rate limits to avoid hitting provider limits:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "github": {
      "rate_limits": {
        "requests_per_minute": 30,
        "tokens_per_minute": 100000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Security Configuration

#### API Token Management

1. Use environment variables instead of config files:

   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your_key_here"
   ```

2. Use read-only tokens when possible:

   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="github_pat_readonly_token"
   ```

3. Rotate tokens regularly:
   - Set calendar reminders for token rotation
   - Use short-lived tokens for sensitive operations
   - Monitor token usage for anomalies

#### Secure File Permissions

Set appropriate permissions on configuration files:

```bash
# On macOS
chmod 600 ~/Library/Application\ Support/ai.cortex-os.cortex/cortex.json
```

### Cloudflare Tunnel Configuration

#### Tunnel Security Best Practices

1. Use custom domains for production deployments:

   ```toml
   [server.cloudflare]
   tunnel_name = "cortex-code-production"
   domain = "cortex.example.com"
   ```

2. Enable authentication for WebUI when exposed via tunnels:

   ```toml
   [webui.auth]
   method = "ApiKey"
   secret_key = "secure-random-key"
   ```

3. Monitor access logs through the Cloudflare dashboard

4. Regularly rotate tunnel tokens

#### Performance Optimization

1. Configure appropriate health checks:

   ```toml
   [server.cloudflare]
   health_checks = true
   ```

2. Use connection pooling for better performance

3. Monitor tunnel metrics for performance issues

### Performance Configuration

#### UI Settings

Optimize UI performance based on your system:

```json
{
  "ui": {
    "refresh_rate": 30,
    "enable_mouse": true,
    "theme": "dark"
  }
}
```

#### Memory Management

Configure appropriate memory settings:

```json
{
  "memory": {
    "retention_days": 7,
    "max_events": 10000
  }
}
```

## Usage Best Practices

### AI Chat Best Practices

#### Crafting Effective Prompts

1. Be specific and clear:

   ```
   Bad: "Fix my code"
   Good: "Fix the null pointer exception in this function that occurs when the user ID is not found"
   ```

2. Provide context:

   ```
   "I'm working on a React component that displays user profiles. Here's the current implementation:
   [code snippet]
   The component is not handling loading states properly. How can I improve it?"
   ```

3. Use follow-up questions for refinement:
   ```
   "Can you explain why that approach is better than my original implementation?"
   ```

#### Model Selection

Choose the right model for each task:

- **gpt-4o-mini**: Quick responses, simple tasks
- **gpt-4o**: Balanced performance for most tasks
- **gpt-4-turbo**: Complex reasoning and analysis
- **claude-3-sonnet**: Detailed explanations and documentation
- **mlx-community/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct**: Local processing, no internet required

#### Streaming Responses

Use streaming for long responses:

- Press `Ctrl+Enter` instead of `Enter` to enable streaming
- Good for code generation, explanations, and creative writing
- Allows you to start reading before the complete response is ready

### GitHub Dashboard Best Practices

#### PR Review Workflow

1. Use the GitHub Dashboard to monitor PR activity:
   - Switch to the PR tab with `Alt+2` then `Tab` to PR view
   - Review PR status indicators (‚úÖ for passing checks, üîç for AI review)
   - Use `Enter` to open PR details in browser

2. Trigger AI-powered code reviews:
   - Use the command palette (`Ctrl+P`)
   - Type "github.review_pr" and execute
   - Review AI suggestions in the PR comments

#### Issue Management

1. Triage issues efficiently:
   - Use the Issues tab in the GitHub Dashboard
   - Review priority indicators (üî¥ critical, üü° high, üîµ medium, ‚ö™ low)
   - Use AI triage with the "github.issue_triage" command

2. Track issue progress:
   - Monitor status changes (open, in progress, closed)
   - Use labels and assignees for organization
   - Set up notifications for assigned issues

### A2A Event Stream Best Practices

#### Monitoring Agent Activity

1. Use appropriate log levels:
   - `1` (Debug): Detailed diagnostic information
   - `2` (Info): General operational information
   - `3` (Warning): Potential issues
   - `4` (Error): Errors that affect functionality
   - `5` (Critical): Severe errors requiring immediate attention

2. Filter events appropriately:
   - Use log level filtering to reduce noise
   - Clear events regularly to maintain performance
   - Pause the stream during intensive analysis

3. Monitor agent health:
   - Watch for error indicators (üî•)
   - Check response times
   - Monitor event processing rates

### Command Palette Best Practices

#### Efficient Command Usage

1. Use fuzzy search:
   - Type partial command names
   - Use keywords to find commands
   - Leverage command categories

2. Learn common shortcuts:
   - `Ctrl+P` to open command palette
   - `Esc` to close command palette
   - `Enter` to execute selected command

3. Use parameterized commands:
   - Provide required parameters when prompted
   - Use default values when appropriate
   - Validate inputs before execution

## Remote Access Best Practices

### Cloudflare Tunnel Usage

#### Secure Remote Access

1. Setup and Authentication:
   - Install `cloudflared` on your system
   - Authenticate with Cloudflare: `cloudflared tunnel login`
   - Configure tunnel settings in Cortex Code
