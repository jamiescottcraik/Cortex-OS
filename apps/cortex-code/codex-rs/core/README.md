## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: brAInwav Production Standards

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: NEVER claim any implementation is "production-ready", "complete", "operational", or "fully implemented" if it contains:

- `Math.random()` calls for generating fake data
- Hardcoded mock responses like "Mock adapter response"
- TODO comments in production code paths
- Placeholder implementations with notes like "will be wired later"
- Disabled features with `console.warn("not implemented")`
- Fake system metrics or data generation

**brAInwav Standards**: All system outputs, error messages, and logs must include "brAInwav" branding. Status claims must be verified against actual code implementation.

**Reference**: See `/Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/.cortex/rules/RULES_OF_AI.md` for complete production standards.

This crate implements the business logic for Codex. It is designed to be used by the various Codex UIs written in Rust.

## Dependencies

Note that `codex-core` makes some assumptions about certain helper utilities being available in the environment. Currently, this

### macOS

Expects `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec` to be present.

### Linux

Expects the binary containing `codex-core` to run the equivalent of `codex debug landlock` when `arg0` is `codex-linux-sandbox`. See the `codex-arg0` crate for details.

### All Platforms

Expects the binary containing `codex-core` to simulate the virtual `apply_patch` CLI when `arg1` is `--codex-run-as-apply-patch`. See the `codex-arg0` crate for details.
