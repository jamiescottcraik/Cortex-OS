## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Outline & Verification Criteria
1. Define document sections matching requirements (project structure, commands, coding style, testing, commits/PRs, optional notes).
2. Establish 200-400 word target and ensure tone aligns with professional, instructional voice.
3. Note required references (Smart Nx commands, CODESTYLE highlights, Conventional Commits) for inclusion.

### Phase 2: Draft & Review
1. Draft AGENTS.md with Markdown headings and concise bullet/paragraph mix.
2. Integrate concrete examples (commands, paths, and naming patterns) without exceeding word budget.
3. Ensure instructions about brAInwav standards and placeholder prohibition are represented appropriately.

### Phase 3: Final Checks
1. Review word count and formatting; confirm heading hierarchy is consistent.
2. Validate content accuracy against research sources and repository standards.
3. Confirm document saved at repository root as AGENTS.md and references reality-filter directives where applicable.
