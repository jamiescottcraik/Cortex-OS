# Security

This document outlines the security features, best practices, and considerations for Cortex Code, ensuring the protection of your data and privacy.

## Overview

Cortex Code is designed with security as a fundamental principle, implementing multiple layers of protection to safeguard your code, data, and communications. This document covers both the current security features and planned enhancements for enterprise deployments.

## Current Security Features

### Data Protection

#### API Token Security

Cortex Code handles API tokens with care:

- Tokens are never logged or displayed in plain text
- Tokens are encrypted when stored in configuration files
- Tokens can be revoked at any time through provider interfaces

Example of secure token handling in configuration:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "github": {
      "token": "ghp_************************************"
    },
    "openai": {
      "api_key": "sk-****************************************"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Transport Security

All external communications use TLS encryption:

- HTTPS for all API calls to AI providers
- HTTPS for GitHub API interactions
- Secure WebSocket connections for real-time features (planned)

#### Input Validation

Cortex Code implements strict input validation:

- Sanitization of user inputs
- Prevention of command injection attacks
- Validation of configuration values

### Authentication and Authorization

#### Local Authentication

In the current terminal-based implementation:

- No user authentication required for local use
- Configuration-based provider authentication
- File system permissions protect configuration files

#### Secure Configuration Storage

On macOS, configuration files are stored in:

```
~/Library/Application Support/ai.cortex-os.cortex/
```

With appropriate file permissions to prevent unauthorized access.

### Cloudflare Tunnel Security

Cortex Code's Cloudflare Tunnel integration provides secure remote access with:

- End-to-end encryption through Cloudflare's network
- No open ports required on your local machine
- Built-in DDoS protection and rate limiting
- Custom domain support for production deployments

#### Tunnel Authentication

Cloudflare Tunnels use secure authentication methods:

- Tunnel tokens for authentication
- Certificate-based authentication for enhanced security
- Support for Cloudflare Access for additional protection

#### Network Security

When using Cloudflare Tunnels:

- All traffic is encrypted in transit
- Traffic routing through Cloudflare's global network
- Automatic threat protection and filtering
- Optional Web Application Firewall (WAF) integration

### Secure Coding Practices

Cortex Code is built using Rust, which provides:

- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Prevention of buffer overflows and null pointer dereferences
- Thread safety through ownership model
- Minimal runtime vulnerabilities

## Planned Enterprise Security Features

### Advanced Authentication

#### Single Sign-On (SSO)

Planned SSO integration will support:

- SAML 2.0
- OAuth 2.0
- OpenID Connect
- LDAP integration

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Support for multiple MFA methods:

- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
- SMS codes
- Hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)
- Biometric authentication

### Encryption

#### At-Rest Encryption

Planned encryption for stored data:

- AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- Key management through AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault
- Automatic key rotation

#### In-Transit Encryption

Enhanced transport security:

- TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Certificate pinning for critical connections
- Mutual TLS authentication for enterprise deployments

#### End-to-End Encryption

Optional client-side encryption for sensitive data:

- Encrypt code before sending to AI providers
- Client-managed encryption keys
- Zero-knowledge architecture option

### Privacy-First Design

#### Data Residency

Control where your data is processed:

- On-premises processing options
- Regional data centers
- Customer-managed AI models

#### Minimal Data Collection

Cortex Code follows a privacy-by-default approach:

- No telemetry data collection without explicit consent
- Anonymous usage statistics (opt-in)
- Clear data retention policies

### Compliance and Governance

#### Audit Logging

Comprehensive audit trails:

- Detailed logs of all system activities
- Immutable log storage
- Real-time log export to SIEM systems
- Compliance report generation

#### Compliance Frameworks

Support for common compliance standards:

- GDPR
- HIPAA
- SOC 2
- ISO 27001

## Security Best Practices

### Configuration Security

#### Secure Token Management

1. Use environment variables for API tokens:

   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-token-here"
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

2. Restrict file permissions on configuration files:

   ```bash
   chmod 600 ~/.cortex/cortex.json
   ```

3. Use read-only tokens when possible:

   ```json
   {
     "github": {
       "token": "ghp_readonly_token_here"
     }
   }
   ```

#### Secure Configuration File Locations

On macOS, ensure configuration files are stored in secure locations:

```
~/Library/Application Support/ai.cortex-os.cortex/
```

With appropriate file permissions:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/Library/Application\ Support/ai.cortex-os.cortex/
chmod 600 ~/Library/Application\ Support/ai.cortex-os.cortex/cortex.json
```

#### Cloudflare Tunnel Security

When configuring Cloudflare Tunnels:

1. Use custom domains for production deployments
2. Enable authentication for WebUI when exposed via tunnels
3. Monitor access logs through the Cloudflare dashboard
4. Regularly rotate tunnel tokens
5. Use Cloudflare Access for additional protection

Example secure tunnel configuration:

```toml
[server.cloudflare]
tunnel_name = "cortex-code-production"
auto_start = true
health_checks = true
domain = "cortex.example.com"

[webui.auth]
method = "ApiKey"
secret_key = "secure-random-key"
```

### Network Security

#### Local Development

For local development:

- Bind services to localhost only
- Use firewall rules to restrict access
- Regularly update dependencies

#### Remote Access

When enabling remote access:

- Use Cloudflare Tunnels instead of port forwarding
- Enable authentication for all exposed services
- Monitor access logs regularly
- Use strong, unique passwords or API keys

### Data Handling

#### Sensitive Data

When working with sensitive data:

- Use local AI models when possible (MLX on Apple Silicon)
- Avoid sending sensitive data to third-party AI providers
- Implement data classification policies
- Regularly audit data access logs

#### Code Review

For code review processes:

- Use AI-assisted review with human oversight
- Implement automated security scanning
- Follow secure coding guidelines
- Regularly update security rules

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### Security Monitoring

Monitor for security events:

- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Configuration changes
