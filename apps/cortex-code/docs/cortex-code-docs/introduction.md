# Introduction to Cortex Code

Cortex Code is a terminal-based user interface (TUI) for the Cortex-OS AI coding agent ecosystem. It enables developers to interact with AI agents, monitor GitHub activity, visualize agent-to-agent (A2A) communications, and execute system commandsâ€”all from a high-performance, low-latency terminal environment. Built in Rust, it emphasizes speed, security, and reliability.

## What is Cortex Code?

Cortex Code addresses several core user problems in modern software development:

- **Fragmented developer workflows** across AI, GitHub, and system monitoring tools
- **Lack of real-time visibility** into AI agent behavior and inter-agent communication
- **Inefficient command execution** and navigation in AI-assisted development
- **Need for secure, performant, and offline-capable** developer tools

## Current Implementation

The current version of Cortex Code provides a comprehensive TUI experience with four main views:

### AI Chat View

Interact with AI agents through a conversational interface with support for:

- Streaming responses for real-time feedback
- Multiple AI providers (GitHub Models, OpenAI, Anthropic, MLX)
- Message history with scrollable interface
- Keyboard navigation and shortcuts

### GitHub Dashboard

Monitor GitHub activity in real-time with:

- Pull request tracking and management
- Issue tracking with priority categorization
- AI task monitoring
- Repository analytics and health metrics
- Five-tab interface (Overview, PRs, Issues, AI Tasks, Analytics)

### A2A Event Stream

Visualize agent-to-agent communications with:

- Live event streaming
- Event filtering by log level
- Agent status monitoring
- Detailed event inspection

### Command Palette

Access unified operations through a searchable interface:

- 30+ available commands
- Categorized by function (GitHub, MCP, A2A, TUI, AI, System)
- Fuzzy search capabilities
- Parameter input for complex operations

### Cloudflare Tunnel Integration

Securely access your Cortex Code instance remotely with:

- Encrypted tunneling through Cloudflare's network
- Custom domain support for production deployments
- API endpoints for programmatic tunnel control
- Built-in security features like DDoS protection and rate limiting

## Future Vision

The roadmap for Cortex Code extends beyond the terminal interface to include:

### WebUI Foundation

- Browser-based interface for broader accessibility
- REST API endpoints for remote operation
- Multi-client access (TUI, WebUI, mobile)
- JSON-RPC style request/response protocol

### SDK Ecosystem

- Python SDK for integration into applications
- TypeScript SDK for web development
- Headless mode for server-side usage
