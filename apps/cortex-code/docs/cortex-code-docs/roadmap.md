# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and enhancements for Cortex Code, organized by release phases. The roadmap represents our vision for expanding Cortex Code beyond its current terminal-based implementation to a comprehensive AI coding platform.

## Current Status

Cortex Code is currently in the **Terminal UI Phase**, providing a powerful terminal-based interface for AI-assisted development with features including:

- Interactive AI Chat with streaming responses
- GitHub Dashboard for real-time activity monitoring
- A2A Event Stream for agent communication visualization
- Command Palette for unified operations
- MCP Integration for tool extensibility
- Cloudflare Tunnel Integration for secure remote access

## Phase 1: WebUI Foundation (Planned)
