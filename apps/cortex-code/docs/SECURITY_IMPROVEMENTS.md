# Security Improvements in Cortex Code v2.0

## Overview

Cortex Code v2.0 includes significant security enhancements to address vulnerabilities identified in previous versions. This document details the security improvements implemented in the v2.0 release.

## Critical Security Fixes

### 1. Command Injection Vulnerability (MLX Provider)

**Issue**: The Local MLX provider was vulnerable to command injection attacks through malicious prompt inputs.

**Fix**:

- Replaced unsafe command execution with secure `Command::new()` approach
- Pass prompts via stdin instead of command line arguments
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Add 30-second timeout for all operations
- Enhanced error handling and logging

**Impact**: Complete elimination of command injection vulnerabilities in the MLX provider.

### 2. Network Binding Security

**Issue**: Daemon mode was binding to `0.0.0.0` by default, exposing the service to external networks.

**Fix**:

- Changed default binding to localhost-only (`127.0.0.1`)
- Added environment variable support for production binding configuration
- Implemented secure binding validation
- Added documentation for proper production deployment

**Impact**: Services are now secure by default with explicit configuration required for external access.

### 3. Input Sanitization

**Issue**: Insufficient input validation and sanitization across multiple components.

**Fix**:

- Implemented comprehensive input validation for all user inputs
- Added sanitization for special characters and control sequences
- Enhanced error handling to prevent information disclosure
- Added resource limits to prevent DoS attacks

**Impact**: Significantly reduced attack surface through proper input handling.

## Security Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite

A new security test suite has been implemented in `tests/security/security_tests.rs`:

1. **Command Injection Tests**: Validates that malicious prompts don't execute system commands
2. **Path Traversal Tests**: Ensures memory storage doesn't access unauthorized files
3. **Input Sanitization Tests**: Comprehensive validation of user input handling
4. **Resource Limit Tests**: Prevents DoS through oversized inputs
5. **Information Disclosure Tests**: Ensures error messages don't reveal sensitive information
6. **Dependency Vulnerability Scans**: Automated checking for known vulnerable dependencies

### OWASP Compliance

The security improvements bring Cortex Code into compliance with OWASP security guidelines:

- **A01:2021 – Broken Access Control**: Addressed through secure network binding
- **A03:2021 – Injection**: Fixed through secure command execution and input sanitization
- **A04:2021 – Insecure Design**: Improved through comprehensive input validation
- **A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration**: Addressed through secure defaults
- **A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components**: Mitigated through dependency scanning
- **A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures**: Enhanced through secure token handling
- **A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures**: Improved through input validation
- **A09:2021 – Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**: Enhanced through audit logging
- **A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery**: Mitigated through network binding controls

## Security Features

### 1. Secure Process Spawning

All external process execution now uses secure methods:

```rust
// Secure approach
let mut child = TokioCommand::new("python")
    .arg("-c")
    .arg(script)
    .stdin(std::process::Stdio::piped())
    .stdout(std::process::Stdio::piped())
    .stderr(std::process::Stdio::piped())
    .spawn()?;
```

### 2. Input Validation

Comprehensive input validation for all user-provided data:

```rust
// Example validation
fn validate_input(input: &str) -> Result<()> {
    if input.len() > MAX_INPUT_LENGTH {
        return Err(ValidationError::TooLong);
    }

    if input.contains_forbidden_characters() {
        return Err(ValidationError::ForbiddenCharacters);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

### 3. Resource Limits

Implementation of resource limits to prevent DoS attacks:

- Maximum input size: 1MB
- Process timeout: 30 seconds
- Memory usage monitoring
- Concurrent request limits

### 4. Secure Configuration

Environment-based configuration for security-sensitive settings:

```bash
# Network binding (required in production)
export CORTEX_BIND_ADDRESS="127.0.0.1:8080"

# MCP Network egress control
export MCP_NETWORK_EGRESS=disabled  # For testing/development
export MCP_NETWORK_EGRESS=enabled   # For production with external tools
```

## Deployment Security

### Production Deployment Guide

The new [Production Deployment Guide](production-deployment.md) includes comprehensive security recommendations:

1. **File System Security**: Proper permissions and ownership
2. **Systemd Service**: Secure service configuration with restrictions
3. **Firewall Configuration**: Network access controls
4. **Backup and Recovery**: Secure backup procedures
5. **Monitoring Integration**: Security event monitoring

### Security Hardening

Recommended security hardening measures for production deployments:

1. **Dedicated User**: Run service under restricted user account
2. **File Permissions**: Restrict access to sensitive files
3. **Network Isolation**: Use firewalls to limit network access
4. **Resource Limits**: Implement system-level resource constraints
5. **Logging**: Enable comprehensive audit logging
6. **Monitoring**: Set up security event monitoring and alerting

## Future Security Enhancements

Planned security improvements for future releases:

1. **Encryption at Rest**: Full encryption for stored data
2. **Advanced Input Sanitization**: AI-powered detection of malicious inputs
3. **Rate Limiting**: Per-user and per-IP rate limiting
4. **Session Management**: Enhanced session security features
5. **Security Dashboard**: Real-time security monitoring interface
6. **Compliance Reporting**: Automated security compliance reporting

## Conclusion

Cortex Code v2.0 represents a significant step forward in security, addressing critical vulnerabilities while maintaining the performance and functionality users expect. The implemented security measures provide a solid foundation for secure production deployments while establishing a framework for future security enhancements.
