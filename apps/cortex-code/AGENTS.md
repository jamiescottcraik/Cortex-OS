## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: brAInwav Production Standards

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: NEVER claim any implementation is "production-ready", "complete", "operational", or "fully implemented" if it contains:

- `Math.random()` calls for generating fake data
- Hardcoded mock responses or placeholder implementations
- TODO comments in production code paths
- Disabled features with warnings like "not implemented"
- Fake system metrics or data generation

**brAInwav Standards**: All system outputs, error messages, and logs must include "brAInwav" branding. Status claims must be verified against actual code implementation.

**Reference**: See `../../.cortex/rules/RULES_OF_AI.md` for complete production standards.

## ðŸ”„ Agentic Coding Workflow for Rust/Codex

All Rust development in brAInwav Cortex-OS must follow this structured 4-phase workflow:

### 0. Tasks

- **Operate on a task basis** - Each Rust feature/bugfix/enhancement is a discrete task
- **Store intermediate context** in Markdown files in the `~/tasks` folder
- **Store all context** in the local memory MCP and/or REST API for persistence
- **Use semantic task ID slugs** - descriptive identifiers like `tui-accessibility-enhancement` or `codex-performance-optimization`

### 1. Research

- **Utilize semantic search** to identify existing Rust patterns within this codebase
- **Use Web-Search** to access the internet for Rust best practices and crate information
- **Begin with follow-up questions** to establish the direction of the research
- **Report findings** in `[feature].research.md` within the tasks folder

**Rust-Specific Research Focus:**

- Existing Rust crate patterns in this workspace
- TUI development patterns with ratatui
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Integration with TypeScript/Python components
- Rust testing strategies with `cargo-insta`

### 2. Planning

- **Read the research file** `[feature].research.md` from tasks folder
- **Develop a TDD plan** based on Rust-specific principles:
  - **Reuse existing patterns** - leverage codex workspace structure
  - **Separation of concerns** - maintain clear crate boundaries
  - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** - focused crate functionality
  - **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)** - share common utilities across crates
  - **Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS)** - avoid unnecessary Rust complexity
  - **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)** - implement only required features
  - **Encapsulation** - proper Rust module boundaries
  - **Modularity** - loosely coupled crate architecture
  - **Open/Closed Principle** - extend via traits and generics
  - **Testability** - design for comprehensive Rust testing
  - **Principle of Least Astonishment (POLA)** - idiomatic Rust patterns
  - **Fail Fast** - robust error handling with Result types
  - **High Cohesion, Low Coupling** - related functionality in same crate
- **Write comprehensive plan** to `[feature]-tdd-plan.md` with Rust implementation context

**Rust Planning Requirements:**

- Include brAInwav branding in CLI outputs and error messages
- Plan for TUI accessibility and keyboard navigation
- Design for cross-platform compatibility
- Consider performance implications and optimization opportunities
- Plan for comprehensive testing with cargo and insta

### 3. Implementation

- **Read the TDD plan** `[feature]-tdd-plan.md` and create implementation checklist
- **Execute with Rust TDD** - write failing tests, implement, refactor
- **Follow codex conventions** - crate naming, formatting, and style
- **Implementation must be 100% deployable** unless explicitly stated otherwise
- **Include brAInwav branding** in all user-facing outputs

**Rust Implementation Standards:**

- Use `just fmt` automatically after code changes
- Run `just fix -p <project>` to resolve linter issues
- Include brAInwav branding in error messages and CLI outputs
- Follow TUI styling conventions from `tui/styles.md`
- Use proper Rust error handling with Result and Error types
- Implement comprehensive testing with deterministic outcomes

### 4. Verification

- **Verify Rust functionality** meets all requirements
- **Run comprehensive testing**:

  ```bash
  cargo test -p <project>
  cargo test --all-features
  just fix -p <project>
  ```

- **Update snapshot tests** with `cargo insta` if UI changes
- **Test accessibility** features for TUI components
- **Validate performance** meets requirements
- **Check brAInwav branding** in all outputs
- **Update task status** to **"verified"** once complete
- **Store Rust insights** in local memory for future development

**Rust Verification Checklist:**

- [ ] All tests passing with proper coverage
- [ ] Clippy lints resolved with `just fix`
- [ ] TUI snapshot tests updated with `cargo insta`
- [ ] brAInwav branding present in CLI/TUI outputs
- [ ] Accessibility features working correctly
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility validated

## Rust Development Guidelines

In this workspace:

- Crate names are prefixed with `codex-`. For example, the `core` folder's crate is named `codex-core`
- When using `format!` and you can inline variables into `{}`, always do that
- Install any commands the repo relies on (for example `just`, `rg`, or `cargo-insta`) if they aren't already available before running instructions here
- Never add or modify any code related to `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED_ENV_VAR` or `CODEX_SANDBOX_ENV_VAR`
  - You operate in a sandbox where `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED=1` will be set whenever you use the `shell` tool. Any existing code that uses that variable was authored with this fact in mind
  - Similarly, when you spawn a process using Seatbelt (`/usr/bin/sandbox-exec`), `CODEX_SANDBOX=seatbelt` will be set on the child process. Integration tests that want to run Seatbelt themselves cannot be run under Seatbelt, so checks for `CODEX_SANDBOX=seatbelt` are used to early exit out of tests, as appropriate

Run `just fmt` (in this directory) automatically after making Rust code changes. Before finalizing a change, run `just fix -p <project>` to fix any linter issues in the code. Prefer scoping with `-p` to avoid slow workspace-wide Clippy builds; only run `just fix` without `-p` if you changed shared crates. Additionally, run the tests:

1. Run the test for the specific project that was changed. For example, if changes were made in `tui`, run `cargo test -p codex-tui`.
2. Once those pass, if any changes were made in common, core, or protocol, run the complete test suite with `cargo test --all-features`.

When running interactively, ask the user before running `just fix` to finalize. `just fmt` does not require approval. Project-specific or individual tests can be run without asking the user, but do ask the user before running the complete test suite.

## TUI style conventions

See `tui/styles.md`.

## TUI code conventions

- Use concise styling helpers from ratatuiâ€™s Stylize trait.
  - Basic spans: use `"text".into()`
  - Styled spans: use `"text".red()`, `"text".green()`, `"text".magenta()`, `"text".dim()`, etc.
  - Prefer these over constructing styles with `Span::styled` and `Style` directly.
  - Example: patch summary file lines
    - Desired: `vec!["  â”” ".into(), "M".red(), " ".dim(), "tui/src/app.rs".dim()]`

### TUI Styling (ratatui)

- Prefer Stylize helpers: use `"text".dim()`, `.bold()`, `.cyan()`, `.italic()`, `.underlined()` instead of manual `Style` where possible
- Prefer simple conversions: use `"text".into()` for spans and `vec![â€¦].into()` for lines; when inference is ambiguous use `Line::from(spans)` or `Span::from(text)`
- Computed styles: if the `Style` is computed at runtime, using `Span::styled` is OK (`Span::from(text).set_style(style)` is also acceptable)
- Avoid hardcoded white: do not use `.white()`; prefer the default foreground
- Chaining: combine helpers by chaining for readability (e.g., `url.cyan().underlined()`)
- Single items: prefer `"text".into()`; use `Line::from(text)` or `Span::from(text)` only when the target type isnâ€™t obvious from context, or when using `.into()` would require extra type annotations
- Building lines: use `vec![â€¦].into()` to construct a `Line` when the target type is obvious; otherwise use `Line::from(vec![â€¦])`
- Avoid churn: donâ€™t refactor between equivalent forms without a clear gain; follow file-local conventions
- Compactness: prefer the form that stays on one line after rustfmt. If both options wrap, choose the one with fewer wrapped lines

### Text wrapping

- Always use `textwrap::wrap` to wrap plain strings
- If you have a ratatui `Line` and need to wrap it, use helpers in `tui/src/wrapping.rs`
- If you need to indent wrapped lines, use the indent options from `RtOptions` rather than writing custom logic
- If you have a list of lines and need to prefix them all, use the `prefix_lines` helper from `line_utils`

## Tests

### Snapshot tests

This repo uses snapshot tests (via `insta`), especially in `tui`, to validate rendered output. When UI or text output changes intentionally, update the snapshots as follows:

- Run tests to generate any updated snapshots:
  - `cargo test -p codex-tui`
- Check whatâ€™s pending:
  - `cargo insta pending-snapshots -p codex-tui`
- Review changes by reading the generated `*.snap.new` files directly in the repo
- To accept new snapshots intentionally, run:
  - `cargo insta accept -p codex-tui`

If you donâ€™t have the tool: `cargo install cargo-insta`.

### Test assertions

- Tests should use `pretty_assertions::assert_eq` for clearer diffs. Import this at the top of the test module if it isn't already.
