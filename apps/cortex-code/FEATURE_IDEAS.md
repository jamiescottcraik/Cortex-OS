# Feature Ideas for Cortex Code TUI

This document outlines potential enhancements to the Cortex Code TUI to expand its functionality and improve the developer experience, incorporating features inspired by OpenAI Codex and other AI coding assistants.

## 1. Enhanced Slash Command System âœ“ IMPLEMENTED

Based on the existing command palette implementation, we have expanded the slash command functionality to include more developer-focused operations, similar to Codex's capabilities:

```rust
// Additional slash commands that could be implemented
vec![
    ("/explain", "Explain selected code or concept"),
    ("/refactor", "Suggest code improvements for selected code"),
    ("/test", "Generate unit tests for selected code"),
    ("/document", "Create documentation for selected code"),
    ("/find", "Search for code patterns in project"),
    ("/fix", "Suggest bug fixes for error messages"),
    ("/optimize", "Optimize performance of selected code"),
    ("/security", "Scan selected code for vulnerabilities"),
    ("/complexity", "Analyze code complexity metrics"),
    ("/dependencies", "Analyze project dependencies"),
    ("/review", "Perform code review on selected code"),
    ("/suggest", "Get AI suggestions for improving code"),
    ("/debug", "Help debug issues with code"),
]
```

These commands integrate with the existing MCP system and AI providers to deliver contextual assistance. Implementation completed in [enhanced_input.rs](file:///Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/apps/cortex-code/src/tui/enhanced_input.rs) and [cortex_command_palette.rs](file:///Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/apps/cortex-code/src/view/cortex_command_palette.rs).

## 2. Project Context Management

A system for managing project-specific context that would enhance AI responses based on the current project, similar to how Codex understands codebases:

### Project Context Features

- Automatic project detection based on current directory
- Context-aware AI responses based on project tech stack
- Project-specific configuration templates
- Recent project history tracking
- Multi-project workspace management
- Codebase understanding with semantic search
- Cross-file reference tracking

Implementation would involve:

- Directory scanning for project markers (.git, package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.)
- Tech stack detection based on project files
- Context serialization for persistence
- Integration with existing configuration system
- Semantic memory with embedding-based storage

## 3. Enhanced A2A Visualization

Improvements to the Agent-to-Agent event stream to provide better observability:

### Enhanced A2A Features

- Filter by agent type (GitHub, Security, Code Review, etc.)
- Visual connection diagrams showing agent interactions
- Performance metrics for each agent
- Historical event analysis and pattern detection
- Export event logs for offline analysis
- Custom event highlighting rules
- Agent collaboration visualization

This would require enhancements to the [A2aEventStream](file:///Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/apps/cortex-code/src/view/a2a_stream.rs#L26-L26) component and potentially a new visualization widget.

## 4. Local AI Model Management

Enhanced MLX integration for Apple Silicon with a dedicated management interface, similar to Codex's local agent capabilities:

### Local AI Features

- Model download and management interface
- Performance monitoring for local inference
- Memory usage optimization controls
- Model switching interface with benchmarks
- Local model fine-tuning capabilities
- Model version management
- Hybrid cloud/local processing decisions

This would build upon the existing [LocalMLXProvider](file:///Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/apps/cortex-code/src/providers/local.rs#L10-L10) and require a new UI component for model management.

## 5. Team Collaboration Features

Multi-user capabilities for team environments, similar to Codex's collaboration features:

### Collaboration Features

- Shared workspaces with team members
- Real-time collaboration on code reviews
- Activity feeds showing team member actions
- Permission management for different access levels
- Shared command history and favorites
- Team-specific configuration profiles
- Code review collaboration with AI assistance

This would require backend services for coordination and new UI components for collaboration features.

## 6. Customizable Dashboard

Enhanced UI customization options:

### Dashboard Customization

- Widget arrangement and resizing
- Theme customization with color schemes
- Keyboard shortcut remapping
- View layout preferences (horizontal/vertical splits)
- Custom status bar components
- Font and size preferences
- Accessibility options
- Personalized AI assistant settings

This would involve extending the existing configuration system and UI rendering logic.

## 7. Advanced GitHub Integration

Additional GitHub workflow features that build on the existing GitHub dashboard, similar to Codex's GitHub integration:

### GitHub Workflow Features

- Automated PR creation from command palette
- Issue assignment suggestions based on code ownership
- Code review status tracking with notifications
- Repository health monitoring with alerts
- Branch management utilities
- Release note generation
- Contributor analytics
- AI-powered pull request suggestions
- Automated code review comments

This would extend the [GitHubDashboard](file:///Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/apps/cortex-code/src/view/github_dashboard.rs#L12-L12) component and integrate with GitHub API enhancements.

## 8. Plugin System

Extending Cortex Code with a plugin architecture that builds on the existing MCP system:

### Plugin System Features

- Dynamic plugin loading at runtime
- Plugin marketplace for community extensions
- Security sandboxing for plugin execution
- Plugin configuration management
- Plugin dependency resolution
- Plugin version management
- Plugin development SDK
- AI-powered plugin suggestions

This would significantly extend the existing MCP functionality.

## 9. Offline Mode Enhancements

Improving offline capabilities, similar to Codex's local agent capabilities:

### Offline Features

- Local caching of documentation and references
- Offline code analysis tools
- Cached AI responses for common queries
- Local command history persistence
- Offline project state management
- Sync capabilities when connectivity is restored
- Local codebase understanding

This would require enhancements to the memory storage system and local caching mechanisms.

## 10. Performance Monitoring

Built-in performance analysis tools:

### Performance Monitoring

- Real-time resource usage display
