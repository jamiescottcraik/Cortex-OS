## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Scope & Criteria Definition

- [x] Derive operational readiness rubric (architecture, quality, security, observability, documentation, deployment tooling).
- [x] Align scoring weightings to produce 100-point scale with 95-point deployment threshold.

### Phase 2: Evidence Collection

- [x] Sample representative packages (agents, orchestration, security, memories) for code quality and testing depth.
- [x] Inventory governance tooling (`tools/readiness`, `scripts`, `.cortex`) to confirm automated enforcement.
- [x] Capture current testing and security automation coverage from `package.json` scripts and associated configs.

### Phase 3: Analysis Synthesis

- [x] Summarize strengths, gaps, and risk factors per rubric dimension.
- [x] Produce prioritized remediation recommendations with effort sizing.
- [x] Compute readiness score with justification referencing collected evidence.

### Phase 4: Documentation

- [x] Author comprehensive report under `docs/` describing methodology, findings, score, and roadmap.
- [x] Ensure report references source files for traceability and adheres to docs authoring standards.
- [x] Surface open questions and dependency on external verification (CI logs, coverage reports).

### Phase 5: Verification

- [x] Review report for compliance with brAInwav reality filter (no unverified claims).
- [x] Validate references and ensure recommendations are actionable.
- [x] Confirm documentation linting expectations (Markdown formatting, headings) are met.

## Checklist

- [x] Rubric defined and weighted.
- [x] Evidence captured for each rubric dimension.
- [x] Score calculated with rationale.
- [x] Remediation plan authored.
- [x] Documentation ready for review.
