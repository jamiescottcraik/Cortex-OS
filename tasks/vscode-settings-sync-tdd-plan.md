# brAInwav VS Code Settings Sync TDD Plan

- **Task ID**: `vscode-settings-sync`
- **Objective**: Update `.vscode/settings.json` so it aligns with the current VS Code Insiders user configuration while
   preserving repository-specific tooling requirements.

## Test Strategy

1. **Configuration Diff Audit**
      - *Red*: Compare workspace settings to user settings and identify missing or divergent keys.
      - *Green*: Apply updates ensuring all relevant user settings are reflected, adjusting values where repository needs
         differ (e.g., interpreter paths, formatter overrides).
      - *Refactor*: Normalize ordering and formatting for readability and lint compliance.

2. **Validation Checks**
   - *Red*: Workspace settings risk referencing invalid paths or conflicting formatters.
   - *Green*: Confirm paths remain valid within repo context and keep ASCII-only output with two-space indentation.
   - *Refactor*: Remove obsolete keys if superseded by user configuration or repository policy.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Merge user settings entries into `.vscode/settings.json`, reconciling conflicts with repository standards.
- [ ] Ensure formatter, linting, and interpreter paths remain correct for collaborators (avoid home directory hardcoding unless required).
- [ ] Sort keys logically (grouped by domain) and maintain two-space indentation.
- [ ] Verify final JSON passes quick inspection for ASCII-only characters.
- [ ] Document any intentional deviations from user settings in the final response.
