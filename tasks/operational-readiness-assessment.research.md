# operational-readiness-assessment.research.md

## Research Objective
Provide a comprehensive technical analysis of the Cortex-OS monorepo with an emphasis on operational readiness indicators targeting a 95/100 deployment confidence score.

## Repository Intelligence
- Monorepo organized around governed Nx workspace with extensive scripts for linting, testing, coverage, security scanning, and operational readiness gates described in `package.json`.
- Architectural layering defined in `docs/architecture-overview.md` emphasizing governed monorepo, contract-first design, and cross-cutting concerns.
- Root README reiterates brAInwav production standards, mandatory agent toolkit usage, and smart Nx execution strategy for affected-only runs.

## Existing Patterns & Signals
- Extensive test commands including targeted suites (integration, security, fuzz, launch readiness) suggesting mature coverage strategy.
- Security posture enforced through Semgrep, gitleaks scripts, and OWASP-aligned profiles.
- Operational workflows revolve around smart Nx wrappers, readiness gates, and memory management scripts to keep agents deterministic.

## Open Questions / Follow-ups
1. Confirm actual coverage metrics from recent reports under `reports/` or `test-results/` to validate badge claims.
2. Validate presence of CI configuration enforcing readiness gates (e.g., GitHub Actions workflows) for completeness of assessment.
3. Determine current state of documentation sync checks referenced in governance instructions.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Perform targeted sampling of critical packages (agents, orchestration, memories, security) to evaluate code quality, dependency hygiene, and test coverage depth.
2. Inspect readiness tooling under `tools/readiness/` to understand scoring rubric and gate configuration.
3. Compile findings into an operational readiness report mapped to scoring rubric with explicit strengths, weaknesses, and remediation roadmap.
