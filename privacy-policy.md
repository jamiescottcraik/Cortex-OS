# Privacy Policy

Memories are stored with privacy-first defaults:

- Personal data is redacted on ingestion.
- Data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM with per-deployment keys.
- Access requires agent, tenant, and purpose authorization.
- Users may request deletion via the forget-me API.

Audit logs omit PII and record redaction status, access decisions, and deletion events.
