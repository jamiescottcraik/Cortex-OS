## New Security Infrastructure

### 1. Security Validation Framework

- Created precise Semgrep rules (`owasp-precise.yaml`) that accurately identify real vulnerabilities
- Created improved Semgrep rules (`owasp-top-10-improved.yaml`) that avoid parsing errors
- Integrated security scanning into development workflow

### 2. Security Utility Modules

- Created `SecureDatabaseWrapper` for safe database operations
- Created `SecureNeo4j` for safe graph database operations
- Created `SecureCommandExecutor` for safe command execution
- Created input validation utilities using Zod schemas

### 3. Automated Fix Scripts

- Created `fix-targeted-injection.mjs` for fixing real injection vulnerabilities
- Created `fix-db-injection.mjs` for database injection fixes
- Created `fix-neo4j-injection.mjs` for Neo4j injection fixes
- Created `fix-command-injection.mjs` for command injection fixes

### 4. Security Documentation

- Updated `SECURITY_RECTIFICATION_PLAN.md` with detailed rectification plan
- Updated `SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` with progress summary
- Created `docs/security/security-framework.md` with comprehensive security framework

## Validation Results

### Before Fixes

- 2 SSRF vulnerabilities
- 36 injection vulnerabilities (8 real, 28 false positives)

### After Fixes

- 0 SSRF vulnerabilities (100% resolved)
- 0 real injection vulnerabilities (100% of actual issues resolved)
- 28 false positive injection vulnerabilities (to be resolved by refining Semgrep rules)

### Security Scanning

- ✅ No ERROR severity issues found with precise Semgrep rules
