# CLI Reference

## ðŸš§ Coming Soon

The Cortex Security CLI is not yet available. We are actively working on adding command-line support to the security package.

**Planned CLI features include:**
- `cortex-security status` â€“ display SPIFFE and mTLS health.
- `cortex-security rotate` â€“ force certificate rotation.
