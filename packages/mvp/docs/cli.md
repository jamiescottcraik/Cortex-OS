# CLI Reference

The MVP package does not ship a standalone CLI. Common developer tasks are exposed through package scripts:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm build` | Compile TypeScript sources |
| `pnpm test` | Run unit tests with Vitest |
| `pnpm dev` | Rebuild on changes |

Future versions may introduce a dedicated `mvp` CLI for validating data and running demos from the terminal.
