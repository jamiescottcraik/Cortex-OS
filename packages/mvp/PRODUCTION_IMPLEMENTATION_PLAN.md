# Production Implementation Requirements for MVP Package

## Current Mocked Components That Need Real Implementations

### 1. MCP Tools (src/mcp/adapter.ts)
- File reading - Currently returns mock content
- Code analysis - Currently returns mock results
- Test execution - Currently returns mock results

### 2. Build Node Validation (src/nodes/build.ts)
- Backend validation - Currently returns mock compilation results
- Security scanning - Currently returns mock CodeQL/Semgrep results
- Frontend validation - Currently returns mock Lighthouse/Axe scores

### 3. Evaluation Node (src/nodes/evaluation.ts)
- TDD cycle validation - Currently uses mock coverage data
- Code review - Currently returns mock quality issues
- Quality budgets - Currently uses mock scores

## Real Implementation Approach

### For MCP Tools:
1. File reading - Use fs.readFileSync or equivalent
2. Code analysis - Integrate with actual static analysis tools
3. Test execution - Actually run test suites

### For Build Validation:
1. Backend validation - Compile actual code and run tests
2. Security scanning - Integrate with Semgrep/CodeQL for real scans
3. Frontend validation - Run Lighthouse/Axe on actual frontend code

### For Evaluation:
1. TDD cycle validation - Check actual test coverage reports
2. Code review - Integrate with code quality tools like ESLint/SonarQube
3. Quality budgets - Extract real metrics from tools

## Priority Implementation Order

1. File system operations (basic requirement)
2. Security scanning with Semgrep
3. Test execution with coverage
4. Code analysis with ESLint
5. Frontend validation with Lighthouse/Axe
6. Advanced metrics collection
