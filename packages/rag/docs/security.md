# Security

- Store API keys in environment variables, never in source control.
- Use HTTPS for all remote embedding and storage calls.
- Rotate tokens periodically and revoke unused credentials.
- Validate document sources to avoid ingesting untrusted content.
- Enable transport encryption when deploying vector stores.
