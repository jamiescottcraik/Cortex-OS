# RAG Package Enhancement Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the key enhancements planned for the Cortex-OS RAG package based on capabilities from external repositories. The enhancements will be implemented following the TDD plan in `qwen-tdd-plan.md`.

## Key Enhancement Areas

### 1. Document Processing

- Diverse format support (PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, images, audio)
- Advanced PDF understanding with table/formula recognition
- OCR and transcription capabilities
- HTML/XML/JSON processing

### 2. Multimodal RAG

- Image processing with VLM integration
- Table structure recognition
- Mathematical expression parsing
- Multimodal knowledge graph construction

### 3. Web Content Acquisition

- Intelligent web crawling with recursive processing
- Targeted scraping with XPath support
- YouTube video processing and transcription
- Content deduplication and filtering

### 4. Code-Specific Enhancements

- Codebase visualization and analysis
- AST-based parsing with Tree-sitter
- Code knowledge graph with relationship mapping
- Repository context generation for AI assistance

## Implementation Priority

1. Core document processing (highest impact, foundational)
2. Multimodal capabilities (extends RAG beyond text)
3. Web acquisition (automates knowledge base building)
4. Code enhancements (specialized functionality for development)

## Expected Benefits

- Support for 15+ document formats
- > 90% accuracy in document structure preservation
- Enhanced understanding of technical and multimodal content
- Automated knowledge base construction from web sources
- Improved codebase understanding for development workflows

## Success Metrics

- Processing time <5s for average documents
- Compatibility with both MLX and Ollama backends
- Plugin architecture for easy extension
- Comprehensive test coverage (>85%)
