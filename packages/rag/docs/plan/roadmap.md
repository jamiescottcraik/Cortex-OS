- Prepare release notes

## Success Criteria

By the end of this roadmap, the RAG package will:
- Support 15+ document formats with >90% accuracy
- Process documents in <5s on average
- Handle multimodal content seamlessly
- Automatically acquire content from web sources
- Provide advanced codebase understanding capabilities
- Maintain compatibility with both MLX and Ollama backends
- Have >85% test coverage
- Include comprehensive documentation and examples

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Performance Issues**: Implement caching and parallel processing early
2. **Compatibility Problems**: Maintain backward compatibility throughout
3. **Dependency Failures**: Provide fallback implementations for critical services
4. **Scope Creep**: Stick to the phased approach with clear milestones
5. **Resource Constraints**: Prioritize high-impact features in each phase
