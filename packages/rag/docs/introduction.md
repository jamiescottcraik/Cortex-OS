# Introduction

Cortex RAG is a retrieval-augmented generation toolkit that powers knowledge-aware agents in Cortex-OS. It addresses two core problems:

1. **Efficient ingestion** of large document sets through configurable chunking and batch processing.
2. **High-relevance retrieval** via multi-model embeddings and reranking strategies.

By combining embedders, vector stores, and rerankers, the package enables agents to answer questions with contextually relevant information.
