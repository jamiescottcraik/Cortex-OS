# Introduction

Cortex Gateway provides a unified HTTP front end for Cortex agents and services. Built on Fastify, it exposes standardized endpoints that forward requests to internal modules and external providers. The gateway solves the problem of coordinating multiple agent capabilities through a single entry point while enforcing schema validation and metrics collection.
