# Accessibility Guidelines

Cortex Gateway does not present a user interface, but when building clients on top of it:

- Ensure UIs consuming the API follow WCAG 2.2 AA guidelines.
- Provide keyboard navigation and descriptive labels in client applications.
- Expose alternative text for any non-text content returned to end users.
