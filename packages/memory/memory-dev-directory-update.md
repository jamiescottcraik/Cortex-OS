# Memory File Discovery Update - /dev Directory

## Additional Discovery Results

**Date**: August 20, 2025  
**Context**: Follow-up scan of `/dev` directory after user reported memory files were found there

## Files Found and Relocated

Successfully identified and relocated **3 additional memory-related files** from the `/dev` directory that were missed in the initial comprehensive scan:

### Development Documentation Files

1. **`dev/memory-patch-summary.md`** → **`apps/cortex-os/packages/memory/docs/dev/patch-summary.md`**
   - **Content**: Minimal patch summary for memory package dependency fixes
   - **Purpose**: Development notes on `undici` dependency resolution for memory tests

2. **`dev/memory-changelog.md`** → **`apps/cortex-os/packages/memory/docs/dev/changelog.md`**
   - **Content**: Changelog for pr-355 memory slice work
   - **Purpose**: Test results and development progress tracking

3. **`dev/memory-bug-list.md`** → **`apps/cortex-os/packages/memory/docs/dev/bug-list.md`**
   - **Content**: Bug list for memory & RAG integration issues
   - **Purpose**: Issue tracking and resolution notes

## Actions Taken

### ✅ File Relocations

- Created `apps/cortex-os/packages/memory/docs/dev/` directory for development documentation
- Moved all 3 files using `mv` commands
- Updated file headers with new locations and relocation timestamps

### ✅ Documentation Updates

- Updated `memory-relocation-plan.md` to include `/dev` directory section
- Updated `memory-relocation-completion-summary.md` with new file count (9 total files moved)
- Enhanced memory package directory structure documentation

### ✅ File Headers Updated

- Added relocation notes with timestamps (2025-08-20)
- Updated titles to reflect new consolidated locations
- Maintained original content integrity
