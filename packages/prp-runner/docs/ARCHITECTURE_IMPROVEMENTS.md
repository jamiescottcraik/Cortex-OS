# Architecture Improvements for PRP Runner

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the significant architectural improvements made to the PRP Runner package to enhance reliability, performance, and maintainability.

## Key Improvements

### 1. MLX-First Model Selection Architecture

#### Implementation
- Created `ModelSelector` class that prioritizes MLX models for zero-cost local inference
- Implemented intelligent fallback chain: MLX → Ollama → Frontier API models
- Added thermal management to prevent overheating on Apple Silicon

#### Features
- Automatic model selection based on task requirements
- Capability-based filtering (code analysis, test generation, etc.)
- Dynamic provider availability checking
- Cost-aware model selection

#### Files Added
- `src/lib/model-selector.ts` - Core model selection logic
- `src/lib/mlx-model-adapter.ts` - MLX-specific adapter

### 2. LangGraph Integration

#### Implementation
- Added LangGraph dependencies (`@langchain/langgraph`, `@langchain/core`)
- Created state graph-based workflows for complex orchestration
- Implemented proper conditional branching and parallel execution

#### Features
- State graph workflow management
- Conditional routing based on execution results
- Built-in error recovery and retry mechanisms
- Workflow visualization capabilities

#### Files Added
- `src/lib/langgraph-workflow.ts` - Generic LangGraph workflow base
- `src/lib/prp-langgraph-workflow.ts` - PRP-specific workflow implementation

### 3. Concurrent Execution with Race Condition Prevention

#### Implementation
- Replaced sequential execution with thread-safe concurrent execution
- Implemented semaphore-based concurrency control
- Added proper error isolation between parallel tasks

#### Features
- Configurable concurrency limits (default: 4)
- Timeout and retry mechanisms
- Immutable state updates
- Error boundaries for each execution

#### Files Added
- `src/lib/concurrent-executor.ts` - Thread-safe concurrent executor
- Modified `src/orchestrator.ts` to use concurrent execution

### 4. Comprehensive Error Handling

#### Implementation
- Created categorized error types for better error handling
- Implemented error boundary pattern with recovery strategies
- Added automatic retry for transient errors

#### Features
- Error categorization (Validation, Network, Timeout, etc.)
- Exponential backoff for retries
- Fallback mechanisms
- Detailed error context and metadata

#### Files Added
- `src/lib/error-boundary.ts` - Error boundary and categorized errors

### 5. Cleanup of Backward Compatibility Code

#### Removed Code
- **Compiled JavaScript files** from `src/` directory (19 files removed)
- **Local reranker fallback** that was never implemented
- **Excessive configuration flags** that were no longer used:
  - `enableMLXGeneration`
  - `enableEmbeddingSearch`
  - `enableRAGEnhancement`
  - `enableFactChecking`
  - `requireHumanValidation`
  - `enhancementEnabled`
  - `enablePolicyCompliance`
  - `enableContentSanitization`
- **Defensive runtime checks** that were no longer necessary
- **GlobalThis process.env access pattern** - simplified to direct `process.env`
- **Model name normalization complexity** - simplified configuration

### 6. Enhanced Testing Infrastructure

#### Implementation
- Added comprehensive unit tests for new components
- Created integration tests for LangGraph workflows
- Implemented TDD-compliant test patterns

#### Test Coverage
- Model selection logic with various scenarios
- Error boundary behavior with different error types
- LangGraph workflow execution
- Concurrent execution safety

#### Files Added
- `src/__tests__/lib/model-selector.test.ts`
- `src/__tests__/lib/error-boundary.test.ts`
- `src/__tests__/integration/prp-langgraph-workflow.test.ts`

## Architecture Benefits

### Performance Improvements
1. **Zero-cost MLX inference** when available on Apple Silicon
2. **Parallel gate execution** with proper concurrency control
3. **Intelligent model selection** reduces API costs
4. **Optimized resource usage** with thermal management

### Reliability Enhancements
1. **Race condition prevention** in state management
2. **Comprehensive error handling** with recovery strategies
3. **Automatic retry mechanisms** for transient failures
4. **Graceful degradation** when services are unavailable

### Maintainability Improvements
1. **Clean separation of concerns** with modular architecture
2. **Type-safe implementations** throughout
3. **Comprehensive test coverage** for critical components
4. **Simplified configuration** without legacy flags

### Developer Experience
1. **LangGraph integration** for complex workflow orchestration
2. **Clear error categorization** for easier debugging
3. **Workflow visualization** for understanding execution flow
4. **Well-documented APIs** with TypeScript support

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Code

1. **Model Selection**: Use the new `ModelSelector` class instead of manual model selection
2. **Workflows**: Migrate to `PRPLangGraphWorkflow` for better orchestration
3. **Error Handling**: Use the error boundary pattern for robust error handling
4. **Configuration**: Remove unused configuration flags from your setup

### Example Usage

```typescript
import { PRPLangGraphWorkflow, ModelSelector, ASBRAIIntegration } from '@cortex-os/prp-runner';

// Initialize components
const aiIntegration = new ASBRAIIntegration();
const modelSelector = new ModelSelector(aiIntegration);

// Create workflow
const workflow = new PRPLangGraphWorkflow(aiIntegration, modelSelector);

// Execute PRP
const result = await workflow.execute(prp, context);
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced MLX Integration**: Direct mlx-knife integration for better performance
2. **Streaming Support**: Real-time output streaming for long-running operations
3. **Workflow Persistence**: Save and resume workflow executions
4. **Advanced Scheduling**: Priority-based task scheduling
5. **Metrics Collection**: Comprehensive performance and usage metrics

## Conclusion

These architectural improvements transform the PRP Runner from a basic sequential processor into a robust, production-ready system with intelligent model selection, concurrent execution, and comprehensive error handling. The new architecture provides better performance, reliability, and maintainability while following modern software engineering best practices.
