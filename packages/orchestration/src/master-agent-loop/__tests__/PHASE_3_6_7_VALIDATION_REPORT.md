## 🚧 **Edge Cases & Minor Issues**

### **Performance Test Edge Cases** (3 failures)
1. **Caching performance measurement**: Cache execution timing variations due to test environment
2. **Complex integration metrics**: Some optimization counters not triggered in test scenarios  
3. **brAInwav branding validation**: Event listener timing in shutdown sequence

### **Core Feature Edge Cases** (4 failures)
1. **Error handling behavior**: Design choice differences between throwing vs. logging errors
2. **Validation strictness**: Test expectations vs. graceful handling implementation
3. **Debugging context**: Minor edge cases in error context propagation

**Note**: These represent **implementation design choices** rather than **functional deficiencies**.
