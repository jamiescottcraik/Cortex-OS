## 🎨 brAInwav Branding Compliance

**Comprehensive Branding Integration:**

- All metric names prefixed with "brAInwav."
- All health check names include "brAInwav" prefix
- All log messages include brAInwav branding
- All error messages include brAInwav context
- Service names default to "brAInwav-cortex-agents"

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Testing Infrastructure

```typescript
import { TestEnvironment, TestSuiteRunner } from './src/testing/test-utilities.js';

const testEnv = new TestEnvironment();
const mockAgent = testEnv.createMockAgent({ name: 'brAInwav-test-agent' });
const response = await mockAgent.execute('test input');
```

### Observability

```typescript
import { observability } from './src/lib/observability.js';

// Metrics
observability.metrics.counter('requests', 1, { endpoint: '/api' });
observability.metrics.gauge('memory', 1024, 'MB');

// Tracing
const span = observability.tracing.startSpan('operation');
observability.tracing.finishSpan(span);

// Decorator
const traced = observability.traced('operation', async () => { /* work */ });
```

### Health Checks

```typescript
import { healthMonitor } from './src/lib/health-check.js';

// Register custom health check
healthMonitor.registerCheck({
  name: 'brAInwav.custom.check',
  checkFn: async () => ({ /* health result */ }),
  interval: 30000,
  criticality: 'important'
});

// Get health status
const summary = await healthMonitor.getHealthStatus();
```

## 📈 Performance & Scalability
