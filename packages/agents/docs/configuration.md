# Configuration

Configuration is primarily via environment variables and `readiness.yml`.

## Environment Variables
- `LOCAL_MEMORY_BASE_URL` – enable governed memory store
- `MODEL_GATEWAY_URL` – route model requests through gateway
- `NODE_ENV` – set to `production` for optimized builds

## Files
- `readiness.yml` – operational readiness rules
- `tsconfig.json` – TypeScript compilation settings
