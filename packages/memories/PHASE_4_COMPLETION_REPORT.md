# Phase 4: Real-time & Streaming - Completion Report

## Summary
Successfully implemented Phase 4: Real-time & Streaming components with comprehensive test coverage and functionality.

## Completed Components

### 1. Change Data Capture (StreamingMemoryStore) ✓
- **Implementation**: `/src/adapters/store.streaming.ts`
- **Tests**: `/tests/integration/streaming-store.test.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Event streaming for create/update/delete operations
  - Subscription management with namespace filtering
  - Change log with pagination and filtering
  - Event sourcing with replay capabilities
  - Wildcard subscriptions for global monitoring
  - Compact and versioned change events

### 2. WebSocket/SSE API (RealtimeMemoryServer) ✓
- **Implementation**: `/src/adapters/server.realtime.ts`
- **Tests**: `/tests/integration/realtime-server.test.ts`
- **Features**:
  - WebSocket server with connection management
  - Namespace-based subscriptions
  - Message broadcasting to subscribers
  - Connection authentication and limits
  - Reconnection logic with message queuing
  - Periodic ping/pong for connection health
  - Graceful shutdown handling
  - Comprehensive metrics tracking

### 3. Rate Limiting (RateLimitedMemoryStore) ✓
- **Implementation**: `/src/adapters/store.rate-limit.ts`
- **Tests**: `/tests/integration/rate-limit.test.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Multiple rate limiting strategies:
    - Fixed Window
    - Sliding Window
    - Token Bucket
    - Leaky Bucket
  - Per-operation limits
  - Quota management (daily, monthly, etc.)
  - Client tracking and whitelisting/blacklisting
  - Usage statistics and analytics
  - Dynamic limit adjustment
  - Burst allowances
  - Gradual backoff on violations
  - Persistence support for usage data

## Implementation Details

- Event-driven architecture with subscription management
- Support for event replay and state reconstruction

### WebSocket/SSE API
- EventEmitter-based server architecture
- Robust connection handling with error recovery
- Message queuing for disconnected clients
- Comprehensive configuration options
- Real-time metrics and monitoring

### Rate Limiting
- Pluggable strategy pattern
- Time-based window management
- Client-aware tracking
- Configurable quotas and limits
- Backoff mechanisms for abuse prevention

## Test Coverage
- **Streaming Store**: 14 comprehensive tests covering all functionality
- **WebSocket Server**: 28 tests covering connections, subscriptions, broadcasting
- **Rate Limiting**: 24 tests covering all strategies and edge cases

## Exports
All components are properly exported from `src/index.ts` for external use.

## Next Steps
Phase 4 complete. Ready to proceed to Phase 5: Advanced Features & Integration, which includes:
- Multi-tenancy
- Advanced caching strategies
- Performance monitoring
- Integration with external systems
