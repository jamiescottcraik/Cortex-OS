# Accessibility Guidelines

- CLI output uses UTF-8 symbols but falls back to plain text when `NO_COLOR` is set.
- Provide textual descriptions when integrating with user interfaces.
- Ensure keyboard-only navigation in any demos or consuming apps.
- Validate documentation with screen readers and maintain high contrast in examples.
