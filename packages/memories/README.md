### `all-files.txt`

A list of all files in the memory systems and structure guard directories.

## Key Enhancements

### Memory Systems

1. **MLX Integration**: Implementation of MLX-based embedding models with secure Python execution
2. **Composite Embedder**: Smart fallback chain (MLX → Ollama → OpenAI)
3. **Memory Store Improvements**: Enhanced SQLiteStore and PrismaStore with vector search and TTL support
4. **Backward Compatibility Cleanup**: Removal of obsolete files
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage for all new functionality

### Structure Guard

1. **Enhanced Validation**: Improved package structure validation
2. **Better Glob Matching**: Enhanced pattern matching capabilities
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage for all validation functions

## Commit Status

Due to system configuration issues (1Password credential helper errors), changes could not be committed directly to the repository. The patch file preserves all changes to ensure no work is lost.

## Next Steps

1. Resolve git configuration issues to enable proper commits
2. Apply the patch to commit changes
3. Push to remote repository
4. Create pull request for review

## JSONL to Memory Conversion

Use the `jsonl:import` script to transform CAI-style `.jsonl` run logs into a reusable memory collection.

```bash
pnpm --filter @cortex-os/memories jsonl:import -- --input logs/run.jsonl --output memory.json
```

Each line of the log is validated against the memory schema and stored with deterministic metadata, enabling stateful reruns.
