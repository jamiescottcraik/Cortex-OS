# üîê Semgrep Security Bot - @ Commands

## Description

**Semgrep Security Bot** is an automated security scanning GitHub App that integrates Semgrep static analysis into your development workflow. It monitors pull requests, pushes, and can be manually triggered to identify security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and compliance violations using Cortex-OS custom rulesets.

### Key Features

- **Automated Security Scanning**: Runs on every PR and push
- **Custom Cortex Rulesets**: Uses tailored security rules for TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Identifies security hotspots, injection flaws, and authentication issues
- **Code Quality Analysis**: Detects anti-patterns and architectural violations
- **Instant Feedback**: Comments directly on PRs with findings and recommendations

## @ Commands

### Security Scans

#### `@semgrep scan`

Triggers a comprehensive security scan of the current branch

```bash
@semgrep scan
```

**What it does:**

- Runs full Semgrep analysis on all supported files
- Uses Cortex-OS security rulesets (JS/TS, Python, aggregate)
- Reports vulnerabilities with severity levels
- Provides fix suggestions where available

#### `@semgrep scan --files <pattern>`

Scans specific files or directories matching the pattern

```bash
@semgrep scan --files "src/**/*.ts"
@semgrep scan --files "apps/api/"
```

#### `@semgrep scan --severity <level>`

Filters scan results by severity level

```bash
@semgrep scan --severity HIGH
@semgrep scan --severity MEDIUM,HIGH
```

### Quick Actions

#### `@semgrep quick`

Performs a fast scan focusing on high-impact security rules

```bash
@semgrep quick
```

**What it does:**

- Runs abbreviated scan with critical security rules only
- Faster execution for quick feedback
- Focuses on injection, auth, and crypto vulnerabilities

#### `@semgrep diff`

Scans only the files changed in the current PR

```bash
@semgrep diff
```

**What it does:**

- Analyzes only modified files
- Compares with base branch
- Provides targeted security feedback

### Configuration

#### `@semgrep rules`

Lists available security rulesets and their descriptions

```bash
@semgrep rules
```

#### `@semgrep config`

Shows current Semgrep configuration and enabled rules

```bash
@semgrep config
```

#### `@semgrep enable <ruleset>`

Enables additional rulesets for scanning

```bash
@semgrep enable owasp-top-10
@semgrep enable secrets-detection
```

### Reporting

#### `@semgrep report`

Generates a detailed security report for the repository

```bash
@semgrep report
```

**What it does:**

- Creates comprehensive security analysis
- Includes trend analysis and metrics
- Exports findings in multiple formats

#### `@semgrep baseline`

Sets current scan results as security baseline

```bash
@semgrep baseline
```

**What it does:**

- Establishes baseline for future comparisons
- Helps track security debt over time
- Enables delta reporting

### Help & Info

#### `@semgrep help`

Shows available commands and usage examples

```bash
@semgrep help
```

#### `@semgrep status`

Displays current scan status and recent activity

```bash
@semgrep status
```

#### `@semgrep version`

Shows Semgrep bot version and ruleset versions

```bash
@semgrep version
```
