# FAQ

**Q: Do I need internet access to run SimLab?**
A: No. SimLab is local-first and runs entirely offline unless you integrate external providers.

**Q: Can I run only a subset of scenarios?**
A: Yes. Use `SimRunner.runScenario` directly or provide a filtered list to `runBatch`.

**Q: Where are reports stored?**
A: By default, reports are written to the current working directory. Use `--output` to customize the path.
