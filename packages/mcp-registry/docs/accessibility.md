# Accessibility Guidelines

The MCP Registry has no user interface. When integrating it into a UI, ensure adherence to [WCAG 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/):

- Provide keyboard navigation for all registry management features.
- Announce status updates through ARIA live regions when adding or removing servers.
