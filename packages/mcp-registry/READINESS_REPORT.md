# Cortex-MCP-Registry Readiness Report

## 1. Executive Summary
The MCP Registry package now validates against JSON Schema 2020-12 and stores manifests in an immutable, content-addressed filesystem with optional ed25519 signatures. Lint passes and coverage improved, but remains below the 95% target at 91.66%.

Overall RAG: **Amber** (Score 75/100)

## 2. Traffic Light Scores
| Area | Score | R/A/G | Evidence |
|---|---:|:---:|---|
| Architecture & Boundaries | 85 | Green | `src/fs-store.ts` lines 1-74 |
| Code Quality & Maintainability | 80 | Amber | `pnpm lint` output shows 0 errors |
| API & Contracts | 90 | Green | `schemas/registry.schema.json` uses JSON Schema 2020-12 |
| Security & Compliance | 80 | Amber | `src/fs-store.ts` lines 1-74 |
| Testing | 70 | Amber | coverage 91.66% (vitest) |
| CI/CD & Release | 40 | Red | no release pipeline or provenance |
| Runtime & Observability | 40 | Red | no metrics or logging |
| Performance & SLOs | 40 | Red | none defined |
| Accessibility & DX | 60 | Amber | minimal CLI docs |
| Registry Governance | 75 | Amber | `readiness.yml` targets mostly met |

## 3. Backward-Compatibility Removals
| File | Lines | Reason | Replacement | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `schemas/registry.schema.json` | 1-4 | Uses draft-07 instead of JSON Schema 2020-12 | Updated `$schema` to 2020-12 | Low |

## 4. Risk Register
| ID | Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Coverage below 95% leaves logic untested | Medium | Continue adding tests for edge cases |
| R2 | Limited observability hampers debugging | Medium | Add structured logs and metrics |
| R3 | Absence of CI/CD pipeline | High | Introduce signed release workflow |

## 5. Performance & Capacity Profile
No benchmarks or SLOs are defined; registry operations run in-process with default Node.js performance.

## 6. Improvement Backlog
- Add tests to reach â‰¥95% coverage
- Introduce structured logging and metrics
- Provide CLI documentation with examples and JSON output
- Establish CI pipeline with signed releases and SBOM generation
