# Introduction

`@cortex-os/contracts-v2` delivers typed message contracts for Cortex OS services. It solves the need for consistent, validated payloads across agents, MCP tools, retrieval systems, and simulators.

The package uses [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) to enforce structure at runtime while maintaining TypeScript types.
