# Accessibility Guidelines

Services themselves are headless, but any accompanying tooling or dashboards should meet WCAG 2.2 AA standards:

- Provide descriptive alt text and labels in user interfaces.
- Ensure keyboard navigation is possible for all features.
- Document keyboard shortcuts where interfaces expose them.
