# Introduction

The services in Cortex-OS provide reusable backend capabilities. The **Model Gateway** proxies third-party model providers through a unified Fastify interface, while the **Orchestration Engine** coordinates complex workflows with reliable rollback and human approval steps.

These services aim to solve common integration problems: consistent API shapes, observability, and secure token handling.
