# Model Gateway Operational Readiness Plan

## Engineering Principles

- **Strict TDD**: begin each feature with a failing test, implement the minimal code to pass, then refactor while keeping tests green.
- **Micro-commits**: one focused change per commit (test and implementation together).
- **Continuous validation**: run `pre-commit run --files <changed-files>` and `pnpm lint && pnpm test` (or `pnpm docs:lint` for docs) before each commit.

## Development Roadmap

### 1. Frontier adapter support

1. Write failing integration tests for `/chat`, `/embeddings`, and `/rerank` using a Frontier stub.
2. Implement Frontier adapter and wire it into `ModelRouter`.
3. Refactor provider configuration to handle Frontier feature flags.

### 2. Parity contracts

1. Add contract tests validating responses against shared schemas/OpenAPI definitions.
2. Implement runtime validation layer enforcing schema parity across providers.
3. Add CI step to run contract tests for every provider.

### 3. Circuit breakers

1. Add failing tests that simulate provider failure and expect requests to trip a breaker.
2. Wrap provider calls with a circuit breaker library (e.g., `opossum`).
3. Export breaker metrics for observability.

### 4. Sticky sessions

1. Add failing tests ensuring requests with the same session ID hit the same backend.
2. Implement session-affinity middleware with in-memory mapping and TTL.
3. Persist mapping to Redis for horizontal scalability.

### 5. VRAM/token budget enforcement

1. Add tests verifying requests exceeding `performance-config.json` budgets are rejected.
2. Implement budget manager enforcing VRAM and token thresholds per request.
3. Emit metrics and alerts when budgets are breached.

### 6. Health and quality scores

1. Extend `/health` tests to expect per-provider health and quality metrics.
2. Collect latency/success-rate data to compute quality scores.
3. Expose metrics endpoint and integrate with monitoring.

### 7. Multi-GPU sharding

1. Add failing tests that distribute requests across multiple GPUs and verify isolation.
2. Implement sharding layer to map sessions/models to GPU shards.
3. Add load tests validating throughput and failover.

### 8. Documentation & examples

1. After each milestone, update `README` and examples with usage and new features.
2. Maintain CHANGELOG entries following Conventional Commits.
