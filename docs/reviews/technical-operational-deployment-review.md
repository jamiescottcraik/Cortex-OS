# Cortex-OS Technical, Operational, and Deployment Review

## Overview
This review highlights the most immediate risks that could block or destabilize a Cortex-OS rollout. Findings are grouped by technical correctness, operational readiness, and product deployment fitness. Each item includes the observed impact and recommended remediation steps.

## Technical Findings

1. **Unbranded error handling in `createGenerate`**
   - **Observation:** `createGenerate` throws `new Error(\`Unknown task: ${task}\`)` when a task mapping is missing, but the message omits the mandated "brAInwav" branding required for user-facing errors. 【F:src/lib/generate.ts†L34-L39】
   - **Impact:** Violates platform compliance rules, making it hard to trace errors back to brAInwav Cortex-OS and likely failing automated branding checks.
   - **Recommendation:** Replace the generic error with a branded variant (for example, `throw new Error('brAInwav generate: unknown task ...')`) and add coverage to prevent regressions.

2. **Lack of resilient fallback logging in `createGenerate`**
   - **Observation:** When the primary MLX provider fails, the catch block marks the model unhealthy but swallows the underlying error, providing no telemetry or structured context for operators. 【F:src/lib/generate.ts†L41-L55】
   - **Impact:** Operators lose visibility into primary-model failures; repeated silent demotions could mask systemic outages.
   - **Recommendation:** Capture the thrown error, emit a structured log/event with brAInwav branding, and consider exposing fallback reason in the return payload for observability.

## Operational Findings

1. **`nx-smart` forces CI mode locally**
   - **Observation:** The wrapper unconditionally sets `process.env.CI = '1'` whenever it runs. 【F:scripts/nx-smart.mjs†L58-L67】
   - **Impact:** Nx treats every invocation as a CI run, which disables interactive prompts, suppresses watch mode, and can cause false cache misses for developers.
   - **Recommendation:** Respect existing `CI` defaults and gate this override behind an explicit flag or environment variable.

2. **`run-tests.mjs` leaks positional arguments**
   - **Observation:** Non-placeholder test invocations forward the entire raw argv array (including the `mode` token) to `pnpm test:smart`. 【F:scripts/run-tests.mjs†L21-L29】
   - **Impact:** Commands such as `pnpm test placeholders` (common in docs) fail because `pnpm` receives an unexpected `placeholders` argument.
   - **Recommendation:** Forward only `rest` for non-placeholder runs or convert the script to subcommand parsing to avoid ghost arguments.

3. **Memory guard relies on POSIX-only tooling and signals**
   - **Observation:** `scripts/memory-guard.mjs` shells out to `ps` and emits `SIGUSR2`/`SIGKILL` signals, which are unavailable on Windows environments. 【F:scripts/memory-guard.mjs†L8-L66】
   - **Impact:** Crashes or no-ops on Windows agents, breaking the "safe" test runner on that platform.
   - **Recommendation:** Add platform guards that disable the feature (with a branded warning) or use cross-platform process inspection libraries.

## Deployment Findings

1. **Invalid `.npmrc` copy pattern breaks Docker builds**
   - **Observation:** The optimized Dockerfile uses `COPY .npmr[c] ./`, which is not valid glob syntax and causes build failures once the Docker context lacks a `.npmr` file. 【F:Dockerfile.optimized†L21-L25】
   - **Impact:** Production builds fail before dependency installation begins.
   - **Recommendation:** Replace the typo with a guarded `COPY .npmrc ./` (or `COPY --chown=... .npmrc .` with `--chmod`), and document the optional nature with `--from` patterns if needed.

2. **Testing stage calls undefined scripts**
   - **Observation:** The Docker testing stage runs `pnpm test:ci`, but the root `package.json` does not define that script. 【F:Dockerfile.optimized†L45-L52】【F:package.json†L1-L122】
   - **Impact:** The image build aborts during the test stage, preventing any deployment artifacts from being produced.
   - **Recommendation:** Point the Dockerfile at the supported entry points (`pnpm test:smart`, targeted `pnpm test:integration`, etc.) or add the missing script.

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize fixes that unblock CI/CD (Dockerfile corrections, `run-tests.mjs` argument handling).
2. Follow up with telemetry and branding improvements in `createGenerate` to meet compliance policies.
3. Introduce platform guards for `nx-smart` and `memory-guard` to avoid breaking local developer environments.
