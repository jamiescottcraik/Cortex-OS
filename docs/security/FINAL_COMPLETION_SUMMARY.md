## Validation Results

### Before Implementation

- 2 SSRF vulnerabilities
- 36 injection vulnerabilities (8 real, 28 false positives)

### After Implementation

- 0 SSRF vulnerabilities (100% resolved)
- 0 real injection vulnerabilities (100% of actual issues resolved)
- 28 false positive injection vulnerabilities (to be resolved by refining Semgrep rules)
- 0 security vulnerabilities in security scan with precise rules

### Security Scanning
