- [ ] Conduct annual penetration testing
- [ ] Perform regular dependency scanning
- [ ] Review and update security policies

### 6.2. Security Monitoring
- [ ] Implement security monitoring
- [ ] Add security alerting
- [ ] Create security incident response plan
- [ ] Establish security metrics and reporting

## Success Metrics

### Security Metrics
- [ ] 100% of database operations use SecureDatabaseWrapper
- [ ] 100% of Neo4j operations use SecureNeo4j
- [ ] 100% of command execution uses SecureCommandExecutor
- [ ] 0 security vulnerabilities in security scan
- [ ] 100% test coverage for security wrappers

### Performance Metrics
