# Cortex-OS Repository Organization

This document outlines the best practices for organizing files and directories in the Cortex-OS repository.

## Directory Structure

The repository follows a structured organization pattern:

```plaintext
/
├── apps/               # Main application code
├── config/             # Configuration files
├── contracts/          # API contracts and schemas
├── docs/               # Documentation
├── libs/               # Shared libraries
├── packages/           # Core packages
├── scripts/            # Utility scripts
│   ├── code-quality/   # Code quality and formatting scripts
│   ├── compliance/     # License and compliance scripts
│   ├── database/       # Database management scripts
│   ├── deploy/         # Deployment scripts
│   ├── fixes/          # Fix scripts
│   ├── security/       # Security-related scripts
│   ├── templates/      # Template files
│   ├── temp/           # Temporary files
│   ├── tests/          # Test scripts
│   ├── updates/        # Update scripts
│   └── utils/          # Utility scripts
├── tests/              # Test files
└── tools/              # Development tools
```

## Best Practices

### General Guidelines

1. **Keep the Root Clean**: Avoid placing files in the repository root unless necessary
2. **Group Related Files**: Place related files in dedicated directories
3. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for files and directories
4. **Documentation**: Include README files in each directory explaining its purpose

### Specific Guidelines

#### Scripts

- Place all scripts in the `/scripts` directory with appropriate subdirectories
- Use clear, descriptive names that indicate the script's purpose
- Include a shebang line (`#!/bin/bash`, `#!/usr/bin/env node`, etc.) for executable scripts
- Document the purpose and usage of scripts in the script itself and in README files

#### Templates

- Place all template files in `/scripts/templates/`
- Use `.template` extension for template files or appropriate exclusion patterns
- Provide standalone examples when appropriate
- Document template usage and customization points

#### Configuration Files

- Place configuration files in `/config/`
- Use environment-specific naming (`.env.development`, `.env.production`)
- Provide example configuration files (`.env.example`) with comments

#### Temporary Files

- Place temporary files in `/scripts/temp/`
- Use descriptive names that indicate the content and purpose
- Clean up temporary files when they are no longer needed
- Add temporary file patterns to `.gitignore`

## File Organization Strategy

When deciding where to place a file, consider:

1. **Purpose**: What is the file used for?
2. **Lifecycle**: Is it temporary or permanent?
3. **Usage**: Who or what will use this file?
4. **Relationships**: What other files is it related to?

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance should be performed to keep the repository organized:

1. Periodically review root directory for files that can be moved to appropriate subdirectories
2. Clean up temporary files that are no longer needed
3. Update documentation to reflect the current organization
4. Consolidate similar scripts and utilities

## Implementation Notes

When implementing organization changes:

1. Update references to moved files in scripts and documentation
2. Test functionality after moving files
3. Document changes for other developers
