# Cortex-OS Security Framework

## Overview
This document outlines the security framework for Cortex-OS, including implemented controls, validation procedures, and ongoing security measures.

## Implemented Security Controls

### 1. Input Validation
- All external inputs are validated using Zod schemas
- Database queries use parameterized statements
- Command execution is sandboxed and validated

### 2. Secure Communication
- All network requests use HTTPS
- Request timeouts are enforced
- Redirects are not automatically followed
- URL validation is performed before requests

### 3. Dependency Management
- Regular security audits using `pnpm audit`
- Dependency updates managed through Renovate
- SBOM generation for supply chain transparency

### 4. Access Control
- Tool allowlists per agent role
- File system write permissions with path restrictions
- Network egress controls

## Security Scanning

### OWASP Top 10 Coverage
We use Semgrep to scan for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Run full security scan
pnpm security:scan

# Run scan for critical issues only
pnpm security:scan:errors

# Run scan for warnings
pnpm security:scan:warnings
```

### Automated Security Validation
Security validation is performed automatically in CI:

```bash
# Validate security fixes
pnpm security:validate
```

## Security Response Process

### 1. Issue Identification
- Security issues are identified through automated scanning
- Issues are classified by severity (ERROR, WARNING, INFO)

### 2. Issue Triage
- ERROR severity issues must be fixed before merging
- WARNING severity issues should be addressed in a timely manner
- INFO severity issues are reviewed periodically

### 3. Issue Resolution
- Fixes are implemented following secure coding practices
- Changes are validated through automated testing
- Fixes are reviewed by security team members

### 4. Issue Verification
- Security scans are run to verify fixes
- Regression testing is performed
- Changes are documented in release notes

## Ongoing Security Measures

### 1. Continuous Monitoring
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- Regular dependency updates
- Security audit reports

### 2. Incident Response
- Security issues are reported through GitHub Security Advisories
- Critical issues are addressed within 24 hours
- Security patches are released promptly

### 3. Security Training
- Developers receive regular security training
- Secure coding practices are documented and enforced
- Security champions are identified in each team

## Compliance

### Standards
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- MITRE ATLAS threat modeling
- Industry best practices for AI/ML security

### Auditing
- Regular security audits
- Third-party penetration testing
- Compliance reporting
