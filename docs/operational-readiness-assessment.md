# Cortex-OS Operational Readiness Assessment

## Objective & Methodology
- **Objective**: Evaluate Cortex-OS for deployment readiness with a 95/100 target confidence threshold.
- **Inputs Reviewed**: Architecture documentation, root operational guidance, readiness tooling, representative package implementations, and security/observability modules.
- **Method**: Applied rubric-driven review (architecture, code quality, security, observability, documentation, operational tooling) backed by direct file inspection.

## Architectural & Governance Assessment (20 pts)
- Governed monorepo principles (strict import boundaries, event-driven interactions, contract-first design) are explicitly codified and documented, demonstrating strong architectural intent.【F:docs/architecture-overview.md†L1-L85】
- Root README enforces brAInwav standards, mandatory agent toolkit usage, and smart Nx execution, signaling disciplined governance for contributions.【F:README.md†L1-L148】
- **Score**: 17/20 — Architecture is well-articulated; however, practical enforcement artifacts (e.g., latest CI logs) were not validated in this pass.

## Code Quality & Testing Assessment (20 pts)
- Workspace exposes comprehensive quality scripts (smart build/test pipelines, coverage gates, fuzzing, launch readiness, mutation testing).【F:package.json†L15-L205】
- Readiness tooling enforces per-package coverage thresholds via schema-driven validation, yet sampled readiness files reveal thresholds set to zero or missing coverage data (e.g., `@cortex-os/security`), undermining enforcement confidence.【F:tools/readiness/check-readiness.mjs†L1-L76】【F:packages/security/readiness.yml†L1-L18】
- **Score**: 14/20 — Automation breadth is excellent, but inconsistent readiness metadata blocks assurance that coverage targets are met.

## Security & Compliance Assessment (20 pts)
- Security package delivers concrete SPIFFE/mTLS tooling with telemetry integration, providing actionable security primitives beyond documentation claims.【F:packages/security/src/mtls/mtls.ts†L1-L104】
- README advertises OWASP-aligned scanning and LLM security coverage; readiness checklist flags security but without measurable thresholds, creating a gap between stated posture and verifiable enforcement.【F:packages/security/README.md†L1-L86】【F:packages/security/readiness.yml†L1-L18】
- **Score**: 15/20 — Strong implementations exist, but automated validation evidence is incomplete.

## Observability & Reliability Assessment (15 pts)
- Observability package standardizes OpenTelemetry exporters and local tooling for spans and metrics, indicating thoughtful instrumentation support.【F:packages/observability/README.md†L1-L18】
- Smart Nx wrapper includes optional OTEL hooks for execution tracing when enabled, supporting operational telemetry for build pipelines.【F:scripts/nx-smart.mjs†L1-L63】
- **Score**: 12/15 — Instrumentation capabilities are present, but adoption coverage across services was not confirmed.

## Documentation & Knowledge Management (10 pts)
- Extensive architectural and operational documentation provides clear entry points (architecture overview, quick start, governance rules).【F:docs/architecture-overview.md†L1-L90】【F:README.md†L46-L171】
- Research and planning artifacts have been initiated for this assessment to maintain traceability and align with mandated workflow.【F:tasks/operational-readiness-assessment.research.md†L1-L33】【F:tasks/operational-readiness-assessment-tdd-plan.md†L1-L45】
- **Score**: 8/10 — Documentation depth is high; however, missing readiness data and unverified badges warrant ongoing curation.

## Deployment & Operational Tooling Assessment (15 pts)
- Nx smart wrapper automates affected-only execution with telemetry integration, non-interactive defaults, and focus validation, reducing operational risk during CI/CD.【F:scripts/nx-smart.mjs†L1-L104】
- Readiness tooling auto-generates per-package manifests with 95% coverage defaults, yet manual overrides to zero thresholds indicate process drift needing remediation.【F:tools/readiness/generate-readiness-yml.mjs†L1-L33】【F:packages/security/readiness.yml†L1-L18】
- **Score**: 13/15 — Tooling is sophisticated, but governance requires reinforcement to maintain intended thresholds.

## Scoring Summary
| Dimension | Weight | Score | Weighted Contribution |
|-----------|-------:|------:|----------------------:|
| Architecture & Governance | 20 | 17 | 17.0 |
| Code Quality & Testing | 20 | 14 | 14.0 |
| Security & Compliance | 20 | 15 | 15.0 |
| Observability & Reliability | 15 | 12 | 9.0 |
| Documentation & Knowledge | 10 | 8 | 8.0 |
| Deployment & Ops Tooling | 15 | 13 | 9.8 |
| **Total** | **100** | — | **72.8** |

**Readiness Verdict**: 72.8/100. Falls short of the 95/100 deployment confidence threshold. Key blockers include inconsistent readiness manifests, unverifiable coverage claims, and lack of validated security gate outputs during this review.

## Priority Recommendations
1. **Rebaseline Readiness Manifests** — Regenerate or update `readiness.yml` files to restore ≥95% coverage thresholds and publish current coverage summaries per package.【F:tools/readiness/check-readiness.mjs†L1-L76】【F:packages/security/readiness.yml†L1-L18】
2. **Surface CI Evidence** — Attach latest coverage, mutation, and security scan reports referenced in the README badges to substantiate quality gate status.【F:README.md†L175-L200】
3. **Enforce Security Gates** — Wire Semgrep and readiness checks into CI to fail on zero-threshold configurations, ensuring security claims reflect actual enforcement.【F:packages/security/README.md†L1-L86】【F:tools/readiness/generate-readiness-yml.mjs†L1-L33】
4. **Instrument Adoption Audit** — Inventory services consuming observability utilities and Smart Nx telemetry to confirm operational coverage; document findings for future audits.【F:packages/observability/README.md†L1-L18】【F:scripts/nx-smart.mjs†L1-L63】

## Open Risks & Follow-Ups
- Coverage and security badge data remain unverified without direct access to generated reports or CI artifacts.【F:README.md†L24-L200】
- Some packages (e.g., `packages/agents`) lack visible readiness manifests, suggesting gaps in readiness governance that must be addressed before deployment.【F:tools/readiness/generate-readiness-yml.mjs†L1-L33】
