# packages/orchestration Technical Review and BVOO Plan

## Technical Review

- `index.ts` exposes comprehensive type and enum definitions, sets defaults for orchestration strategy and timeouts, and surfaces the PRP engine functions for external consumers.
- `prp-integration.ts` centralizes engine creation and task orchestration. It guards against deprecated options, enforces a concurrency limit, and emits orchestration-completed events, but lacks per-task timeout handling and explicit resource cleanup beyond a simple map clear.
- `service.ts` wraps the PRP engine with an OpenTelemetry span yet omits shutdown hooks or error propagation, which could leave spans or engine state open in long-running services.
- `workflow-validator.ts` maintains an in-memory cache with periodic clearing, but no size/TTL limits and uses `console.warn` instead of structured logging for unreachable steps, risking noisy output in production.
- Test coverage focuses on PRP orchestration behavior and concurrency, while service initialization and workflow cache scenarios remain untested.

## Engineering Principle

**Bounded, Validated, Observable Orchestration (BVOO):** Every orchestration workflow must validate inputs before execution, enforce explicit bounds on concurrency, time, and cache size, and emit structured telemetry for all lifecycle events.

## TDD Implementation Plan

1. **Cache TTL & size limits**
   - Write failing tests asserting cached workflow entries expire and the cache never exceeds a fixed size.
   - Implement LRU/TTL eviction respecting BVOO bounds.
2. **Structured unreachable-step warnings**
   - Add failing test expecting logger-based warnings for unreachable workflow steps.
   - Replace `console.warn` with injected logger; ensure test passes.
3. **Engine lifecycle management**
   - Create failing test verifying `provideOrchestration` exposes a `shutdown` method that clears active orchestrations and stops timers.
   - Implement method and update span handling.
4. **Task-level timeouts**
   - Introduce failing test ensuring tasks exceeding configured `executionTimeout` reject with a timeout error.
   - Implement timeout control in `orchestrateTask`.
5. **Validator metrics coverage**
   - Add failing test checking `validateWorkflowWithMetrics` returns accurate cache-hit and step-count metrics.
   - Implement hit-rate tracking and expose via `getValidationCacheStats`.
6. **Documentation and examples**
   - Update README with the BVOO principle and usage examples once tests pass.
