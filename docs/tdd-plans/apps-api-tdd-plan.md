# Apps API Development Plan

## Technical Review of `apps/api`

- Directory only contains a Dockerfile; no source code, tests, or `requirements.txt` were found.
- Dockerfile targets Python 3.13, installs optional dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and launches a Uvicorn app `src.api.endpoints:app` with a built-in healthcheck on port 8082.

## Engineering Principle: Operational Readiness First

1. **TDD at Every Layer** – Write failing tests before implementing code; every commit must leave the system deployable.
2. **Single-Responsibility Commits** – Each commit encapsulates one logically complete change with tests, docs, and validation.
3. **Fail-Fast Deployment** – Container builds, health checks, and security scans must run on every change.
4. **Observability by Default** – Metrics, structured logs, and health endpoints are mandatory for all services.
5. **Pinned Dependencies & Reproducible Builds** – All runtime and test dependencies are version-locked and verified.

## TDD-Driven Implementation Plan

| #   | Task                                            | Test-First Action                                          | Implementation                                                 | Commit Example                                |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Scaffold Python module (`src/api/endpoints.py`) | Add failing pytest for `/health` returning `200 OK`        | Implement minimal FastAPI app with health route                | `feat(api): scaffold fastapi health endpoint` |
| 2   | Dependency management                           | Add failing test importing FastAPI                         | Create `requirements.txt`/`pyproject` pinning FastAPI & pytest | `chore(api): add python deps`                 |
| 3   | Root route                                      | Write failing test for `/` returning service metadata      | Implement route and response model                             | `feat(api): add root endpoint`                |
| 4   | Config & logging                                | Test that env vars load via `pydantic` Settings            | Implement config module + structured logging                   | `feat(api): add config and logging`           |
| 5   | Error handling                                  | Test that invalid routes return JSON 404                   | Add global exception handlers                                  | `feat(api): standardize error responses`      |
| 6   | Observability                                   | Test that `/metrics` exposes Prometheus data               | Integrate `prometheus-client`                                  | `feat(api): expose metrics endpoint`          |
| 7   | CI hooks                                        | Add failing workflow test ensuring `pre-commit run` passes | Configure pre-commit, lint, and pytest in CI                   | `ci(api): enforce lint and tests`             |
| 8   | Docker polish                                   | Test container build executes healthcheck script           | Add `docker-compose` service and smoke test                    | `chore(api): finalize docker build`           |
| 9   | Security scan                                   | Add failing semgrep rule for deprecated APIs               | Configure semgrep run in CI                                    | `chore(api): add security scanning`           |
| 10  | Deployment readiness                            | Write integration test hitting containerized service       | Create release scripts & docs                                  | `chore(api): document deployment flow`        |
