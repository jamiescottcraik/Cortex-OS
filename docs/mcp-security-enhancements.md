# MCP Implementation - Security Enhancements

## Overview
This document outlines the security enhancements made to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation, addressing the four immediate recommendations from the audit.

## 1. Complete SSE Transport Implementation ✅

### Features Implemented
- Full EventSource-based SSE transport with proper connection handling
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Message validation and error handling
- Support for custom event types
- Process monitoring and resource management

### Security Features
- Proper CORS handling
- Message validation and sanitization
- Secure reconnection mechanisms
- Authentication support via HTTP headers

### Interface
```typescript
const sseClient = createSSE({
  endpoint: 'https://api.example.com/mcp/events'
});

sseClient.onMessage((data) => {
  console.log('Received message:', data);
});

await sseClient.connect();
```

## 2. Add Rate Limiting Mechanisms ✅

### Features Implemented
- Built-in rate limiting for HTTPS transport
- Configurable time windows and request limits
- Per-tool rate limiting
- Rate limit information retrieval

### Security Features
- Prevents denial of service attacks
- Fair usage policies enforcement
- Automatic cleanup of old rate limit data

### Interface
```typescript
const httpsClient = createHTTPS({
  endpoint: 'https://api.example.com/mcp'
});

const result = await httpsClient.callTool('search', {
  query: 'test search'
});

console.log('Rate limit remaining:', httpsClient.getRateLimitInfo('search'));
```

## 3. Enhance Data Redaction ✅

### Features Implemented
- Comprehensive data redaction for sensitive information
- Multiple pattern matching for API keys, tokens, passwords, and secrets
- Automatic redaction in both sent and received messages
- Process monitoring and restart capabilities

### Security Features
- Prevents API key leakage
- Protects authentication tokens
- Redacts passwords and secrets
- Maintains data structure while removing sensitive content

### Interface
```typescript
const stdioClient = createStdIo({
  name: 'echo-server',
  transport: 'stdio',
  command: 'node',
  args: ['echo-server.js']
});

// Sensitive data is automatically redacted
stdioClient.send({ apiKey: 'sk-1234567890abcdef' });
// Actually sends: { apiKey: '[REDACTED]' }
```

## 4. Improve Documentation ✅

### Features Implemented
- Comprehensive inline documentation for all modules
- Detailed security considerations for each component
- Usage examples and best practices
- Performance characteristics and limitations

### Documentation Coverage
- SSE transport implementation
- HTTPS transport with rate limiting
- STDIO transport with resource limiting and redaction
- Client creation and usage patterns
- Error handling and troubleshooting

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage
- Transport matrix tests for interface parity
- Protocol conformance tests for capability discovery
- Security policy tests for auth requirements and tool safety
- Prompt template snapshot tests for redaction
- Rate limiting tests
- Data redaction tests

### Security Validation
- All transports expose consistent APIs
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Data redaction prevents information leakage
- Process monitoring ensures resource management
- Error handling prevents crashes and information disclosure

## Conclusion

All four immediate recommendations from the MCP audit have been successfully implemented:

1. ✅ **Complete SSE Transport**: Fully implemented EventSource-based SSE transport
2. ✅ **Add Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting mechanisms for HTTPS transport
3. ✅ **Enhance Redaction**: Comprehensive data redaction for sensitive information
4. ✅ **Improve Documentation**: Detailed inline documentation for all components

These enhancements significantly improve the security posture of the MCP implementation while maintaining backward compatibility and performance.
