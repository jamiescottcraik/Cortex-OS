# Cortex-OS Investor Readiness Report

## Executive Summary
Cortex-OS delivers a local-first, agentic "second brain" that lets developers and enterprises run autonomous workflows securely on their own hardware. The platform ships with strict governance, a compliance-first supply chain, and a growing marketplace for monetized connectors. Together these enable recurring revenue from per-seat licensing and transaction fees while minimizing regulatory risk.

**ROI Highlights**
- 3-year ARR path from $10M to $285M drives ~5x capital efficiency.
- Marketplace fees add high-margin revenue with minimal OPEX.

## Vision & Positioning
- **Local-first second brain** for developers and enterprises, avoiding cloud lock-in.
- Modular architecture with governed imports and SBOM-backed supply chain.

## Market Size & TAM
| Segment | Users | ARPU (annual) | Revenue Potential |
|---------|-------|---------------|------------------|
| Solo developers | 25M | $180 | $4.5B TAM |
| Enterprise seats | 5M | $240 | $1.2B TAM |
| Marketplace connectors | 50k listings | $200 avg fee | $10M GMV |

Estimated **SAM**: 10% of TAM through early adopter channels (≈$570M). **SOM**: 5% penetration in 3 years (≈$285M ARR).

### ARR Projection
| Year | ARR (M USD) |
|------|-------------|
| 2025 | 10 |
| 2026 | 120 |
| 2027 | 285 |

## Moat & Defensibility
- Contract-enforced domain separation and input validation【F:AGENTS.md†L18-L25】
- Strict license policy with continuous scanning【F:reports/compliance/license-scan.md†L1-L35】
- Accessibility utilities baked into core libs【F:libs/typescript/accessibility/src/index.ts†L1-L30】

## Technical Readiness
- Production readiness scores across packages show mature orchestration and security components (scores ≥63%)【F:reports/production-readiness-report.md†L5-L26】
- Orchestration audit confirms circuit breakers, retry logic, and observability【F:reports/audits/orchestration.audit.md†L16-L23】

## Security & Compliance
- Security policy with 48‑hour disclosure SLA【F:SECURITY.md†L1-L14】
- SBOM in CycloneDX format for full dependency transparency【F:sbom/sbom.cdx.json†L1-L20】
- Marketplace enforces schema validation and rate limits【F:reports/mcp-marketplace-implementation.md†L9-L24】

## Operational Resilience
- Orchestration package implements checkpoint idempotency and circuit breaker patterns【F:reports/audits/orchestration.audit.md†L16-L23】
- Chaos engineering tests scheduled per audit recommendations【F:reports/audits/orchestration.audit.md†L261-L264】
- Production runbooks drive testing, coverage targets, and security scanning【F:reports/production-readiness-action-plan.md†L1-L8】

## Accessibility Edge
- WCAG 2.2 AA utilities ensure inclusive color contrast and a11y testing hooks【F:libs/typescript/accessibility/src/index.ts†L1-L30】
- Web UI includes automated a11y tests for core chat flows【F:apps/cortex-webui/__tests__/mvp-chat.a11y.test.ts†L1-L20】

## Monetization
- Dual licensing (Apache-2.0 + commercial EULA) enables per-seat ARR and premium features【F:COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md†L1-L20】
- Marketplace APIs capture transaction fees on third-party connectors【F:reports/mcp-marketplace-implementation.md†L9-L24】

## Risk Register & Mitigations
| ID | Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|----|------|----------|------------|
| R1 | Regulatory drift (GDPR/EU AI Act) | High | Automated GDPR erasure and AI Act compliance checks |
| R2 | Supply chain vulnerabilities | Medium | SBOM scanning and license gating in CI |
| R3 | Adoption speed slower than forecast | Medium | Freemium CLI + community connectors to drive funnel |
| R4 | Resilience gaps (chaos tests pending) | Medium | Deploy chaos suite and track MTTR |
