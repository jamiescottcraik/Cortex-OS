# CLI Tools Integration Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of all CLI tools integrated into the
Cortex-OS project for development, security, and workflow management.

## 🔍 Security Scanning - Semgrep

Semgrep is integrated for comprehensive security analysis with multiple rulesets:

### Available Scripts (Security Scanning)

- `pnpm security:scan` - OWASP security scan (ERROR level only)
- `pnpm security:scan:all` - Combined OWASP precise + top 10 improved rules
- `pnpm security:scan:llm` - Custom LLM-specific security rules
- `pnpm security:scan:atlas` - MITRE ATLAS framework rules
- `pnpm security:scan:ci` - CI-friendly scan with JSON output

### Current Status (Security Scanning)

- ✅ 18 security findings identified in main scan
- ✅ 154 findings from LLM-specific rules
- ✅ Custom rules for hardcoded secrets, prompt injection, and unsafe eval
- ✅ Memory-optimized configuration (2GB limit)

### Configuration Files

- `.semgrep/owasp-precise.yaml` - OWASP precise rules
- `.semgrep/owasp-top-10-improved.yaml` - Enhanced OWASP Top 10
- `.semgrep/owasp-llm-top-ten.yaml` - Custom LLM security rules
- `.semgrep/mitre-atlas.yaml` - MITRE ATLAS framework

## 🌊 Git Workflow - Graphite CLI

Graphite CLI is integrated for modern Git workflow management with stacked PRs:

### Available Scripts (Git Workflow)

- `pnpm graphite:stack` - View and manage stack operations
- `pnpm graphite:branch` - Create and manage feature branches
- `pnpm graphite:submit` - Submit stacked PRs to GitHub
- `pnpm graphite:restack` - Rebase and fix stack conflicts
- `pnpm graphite:sync` - Sync with remote repository

### Current Status (Git Workflow)

- ✅ Graphite CLI 1.6.8 installed and operational
- ✅ Configuration file created (`.graphite_config`)
- ✅ Auto-submit, branch tracking, and CI integration configured

### Configuration Features

- Auto-submit when PRs are approved
- Feature branch prefix: `feature/`
- CI checks required: lint, test, security
- Auto-assign reviewers based on CODEOWNERS

## 📊 Diagram Generation - Mermaid CLI

Mermaid CLI is integrated for creating diagrams from text descriptions:

### Available Scripts (Diagram Generation)

- `pnpm mermaid:generate` - Generate all .mmd files to PNG
- `pnpm mermaid:docs` - Generate architecture diagram
- `pnpm mermaid:workflow` - Generate workflow diagrams
- `pnpm mermaid:validate` - Validate all Mermaid files

### Current Status (Diagram Generation)

- ✅ Mermaid CLI 11.9.0 installed and operational
- ✅ Architecture diagram created and generated
- ✅ Custom styling configuration (`.mermaidrc`)
- ✅ PNG generation working correctly

### Generated Diagrams

- `docs/architecture.png` - System architecture overview
- Styled with custom color scheme and professional appearance

## 🛠 Development Workflow Integration

### ESLint + SonarJS Status

- ✅ Lint errors reduced from 2883 to 395 (86% reduction)
- ✅ SonarJS security rules active
- ✅ TypeScript parsing errors fixed
- ✅ CommonJS file support added

### Package Management

- ✅ All dependencies installed and updated
- ✅ pnpm workspace with 40 packages
- ✅ Turbo.json orchestration
- ✅ Cross-env for Windows compatibility

## 🚀 CI/CD Integration Ready

All tools are configured for CI/CD integration:

### Security Pipeline

```bash
# Run in CI
pnpm security:scan:ci  # Outputs JSON for processing
pnpm lint             # Code quality checks
pnpm test             # Unit tests
```

### Documentation Pipeline

```bash
# Generate diagrams
pnpm mermaid:generate
# Validate architecture
pnpm mermaid:validate
```

### Workflow Pipeline

```bash
# Stack management
pnpm graphite:stack restack
pnpm graphite:submit
```

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Security**: Review and address the 18 critical security findings
2. **Documentation**: Create more Mermaid diagrams for different system views
3. **Workflow**: Set up team Graphite workflows and PR templates
4. **Automation**: Integrate all tools into GitHub Actions workflows

## 🔧 Configuration Files Created

- `.graphite_config` - Graphite CLI configuration
- `.mermaidrc` - Mermaid styling configuration
- `.semgrep/owasp-llm-top-ten.yaml` - Custom LLM security rules
- `docs/architecture.mmd` - Architecture diagram source
- Enhanced `package.json` with 12 new CLI tool scripts

## 📈 Metrics

- **Security Coverage**: 4 different rulesets active
- **Code Quality**: 86% reduction in lint errors
- **Documentation**: Architecture diagram auto-generated
- **Workflow**: Modern stacked PR workflow ready
- **Performance**: Memory-optimized configurations for large monorepo
