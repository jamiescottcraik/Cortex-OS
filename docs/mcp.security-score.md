```

## Score Justification

The MCP implementation demonstrates a strong security-first approach with several notable strengths:

1. **Comprehensive Security Framework**: The implementation includes a detailed security policy framework with tool classifications, side effect controls, and approval workflows.

2. **Robust Input Validation**: Strong validation is implemented for URLs, API keys, commands, and other inputs.

3. **Consistent Transport Interfaces**: All transports expose consistent APIs, making the system predictable and easier to secure.

4. **Proper Data Handling**: API keys are automatically redacted from URLs and logs include security event tracking.

However, there are areas for improvement:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The SSE transport is only partially implemented.

2. **Missing Security Features**: Rate limiting and comprehensive data redaction are not fully implemented.

3. **Limited Documentation**: While the code is generally clear, more detailed documentation would improve maintainability and security.

4. **Resource Management**: Limited resource limiting for spawned processes.

The overall score of 8.2/10 reflects a solid security implementation with room for improvement in specific areas. The high scores in critical areas like tool safety and transport security demonstrate the strong foundation of the implementation.
