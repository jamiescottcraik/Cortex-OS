# Auth Hardening Summary

## Overview

Implemented persistence-backed multi-factor authentication and passkey support for the brAInwav Cortex-OS API.
All endpoints now route through production-ready services with Postgres/Prisma storage and official Better Auth adapters.

## Key Changes

- Replaced stubbed 2FA handlers with `twoFactorService` that issues TOTP secrets, verifies codes, and manages hashed backup codes in Prisma.
- Added `passkeyService` to register and authenticate WebAuthn credentials using the Better Auth context while
  persisting credential metadata (credential ID, public key, transports, sign count).
- Updated `apps/api/src/routes/auth.ts` to delegate every 2FA and passkey route to the new services and to return brAInwav-branded error messaging.
- Extended `apps/api/tests/auth/features.spec.ts` to exercise the full lifecycle for TOTP setup, invalid code handling,
  backup code redemption, passkey registration, and passkey authentication.

## Validation

- Persistence suite: `pnpm vitest run --config vitest.workspace.ts apps/api/tests/auth/persistence.spec.ts`
- Feature suite (requires workspace config): `pnpm vitest run --config vitest.workspace.ts apps/api/tests/auth/features.spec.ts`
- Both suites rely on the Testcontainers-backed Postgres instance and the official Better Auth Prisma adapter.

## Follow-Up

- Monitor Vitest workspace configuration so that `vitest.workspace.ts` resolves correctly when running individual files.
- Update public-facing documentation to highlight 2FA and passkey availability for Cortex-OS deployments.
- Add automation to seed demo TOTP secrets and WebAuthn credentials for staging environments.
