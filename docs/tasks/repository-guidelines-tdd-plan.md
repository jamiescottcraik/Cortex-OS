## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Outline & Verification Criteria
1. Define document sections matching requirements (structure, commands, style, testing, commits/PRs, security notes).
2. Establish 200-400 word target and ensure tone aligns with professional, instructional voice.
3. Note required references (Smart Nx commands, CODESTYLE highlights, Conventional Commits, workflow directives) for inclusion.

### Phase 2: Draft & Review
1. Draft AGENTS.md with Markdown headings and concise bullets.
2. Integrate concrete examples (commands, paths, naming) without exceeding the word budget.
3. Ensure instructions about brAInwav production standards, agent workflow, local memory, and reality filter are represented.

### Phase 3: Final Checks
1. Review word count and formatting; confirm heading hierarchy is consistent.
2. Validate content accuracy against research sources and repository standards.
3. Confirm document saved at repository root as AGENTS.md and checklist items updated.
