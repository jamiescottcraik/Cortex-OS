## Command Combinations

You can chain multiple commands or use multiple apps together:

```markdown
@semgrep scan --severity high
@insula autofix
@structure validate
```

## Response Format

Apps will respond with:

- ‚úÖ Success indicators
- ‚ùå Error messages with details
- üìä Summary reports
- üîó Links to detailed results
- üí° Suggestions for improvements

## Security & Permissions

### Required Permissions

All apps require these base permissions:

- **Contents**: Read & Write (for code analysis and fixes)
- **Pull requests**: Read & Write (for comments and reviews)
- **Issues**: Read & Write (for issue tracking)
- **Checks**: Write (for status updates)

### Webhook Security

Each app uses webhook secrets for secure communication:

- Generated using `./scripts/webhook-secret <app-name>`
- Verified on every webhook request
- Rotated periodically for security

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **App not responding**:

   ```markdown
   @<app-name> ping
   ```

2. **Permission errors**:
   - Check repository permissions
   - Verify app installation

3. **Webhook timeouts**:
   - Commands may take time for large repositories
   - Apps will update with progress indicators

### Getting Help

```markdown
@semgrep help
@insula help
@structure help
@cortex-ai help
```

Each app provides context-specific help for their available commands.

## Configuration Files

### Semgrep Configuration

```yaml
# .semgrep.yml
rules:
  - id: security-rules
    severity: high
    enabled: true
ignore:
  - "test/**"
  - "docs/**"
```

### Insula Configuration

```json
{
  "insula": {
    "organization": {
      "enabled": true,
      "rules": ["typescript-structure", "package-organization"]
    },
    "automation": {
      "auto-fix": true,
      "auto-docs": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Integration Examples

### In Pull Request Reviews

```markdown
Thanks for the PR! Let's run some checks:

@semgrep scan --severity medium
@insula validate
@structure check

Once these pass, we can proceed with the review.
```

### In Issue Comments

```markdown
Let's investigate this security concern:

@semgrep scan --rule-set security
@insula compliance check

@semgrep, can you also check for similar patterns in other files?
```

### For Maintenance Tasks

```markdown
Monthly maintenance run:

@insula deps audit
@insula cleanup
@semgrep config update
@structure validate

Please generate a summary report after completion.
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Use targeted commands rather than broad scans
2. **Chain Commands**: Combine related commands for efficiency
3. **Monitor Progress**: Large operations may take time
4. **Review Results**: Always review automated changes before merging
5. **Use Baselines**: Compare against main branch for incremental checks

## API Integration

For programmatic access, each app also provides REST API endpoints:

```bash
# Semgrep API
curl -X POST https://semgrep-github.brainwav.io/api/scan \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"repository": "owner/repo", "ref": "main"}'

# Insula API  
curl -X POST https://insula-insula.brainwav.io/api/organize \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"repository": "owner/repo", "action": "validate"}'
```
