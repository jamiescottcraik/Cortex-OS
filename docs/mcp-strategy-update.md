# MCP Implementation Strategy Update

## Current Situation

We've been implementing custom transport implementations when we should be using the official Model Context Protocol TypeScript SDK that's already installed in our project:

- Official SDK: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (v1.17.4)
- Already partially used in some parts of our codebase
- Provides complete implementations of all required transports

## Recommended Approach

1. **Use the official SDK** instead of our custom implementations
2. **Remove our custom transport implementations** in `packages/mcp/mcp-transport/src/`
3. **Update our client factory** to use the official SDK clients
4. **Preserve our security enhancements** (rate limiting, data redaction, etc.) as wrapper functions
5. **Keep our tests** but update them to work with the official SDK

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Replace Custom Implementations with Official SDK

1. Update `packages/mcp/mcp-core/src/client.ts` to use official SDK
2. Remove custom transport implementations in `packages/mcp/mcp-transport/src/`
3. Update tests to work with official SDK interfaces

### Phase 2: Preserve Security Enhancements

1. Keep rate limiting functionality as wrapper around official SDK
2. Keep data redaction functionality as utility functions
3. Keep process monitoring functionality where applicable

### Phase 3: Update Documentation

1. Update documentation to reflect use of official SDK
2. Document our security enhancements as additions to official SDK
3. Update examples to use official SDK patterns

## Benefits of Using Official SDK

1. **Reduced Maintenance Burden**: No need to maintain custom transport implementations
2. **Better Security**: Official SDK is regularly updated and security-reviewed
3. **Feature Completeness**: Access to all official SDK features and improvements
4. **Compatibility**: Guaranteed compatibility with MCP specification
5. **Community Support**: Benefit from community contributions and bug fixes

## Migration Path

### Before (Custom Implementation)

```typescript
import { createStdIo } from '../mcp-transport/src/stdio.js';
import { createSSE } from '../mcp-transport/src/sse.js';
import { createHTTPS } from '../mcp-transport/src/https.js';

const client = createStdIo({
  /* config */
});
```

### After (Official SDK)

```typescript
import { Client } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js';
import { StdioClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js';
import { SSEClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/sse.js';
import { StreamableHTTPClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/streamableHttp.js';

const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
  /* config */
});
const client = new Client({ name: 'my-client', version: '1.0.0' });
await client.connect(transport);
```

## Security Enhancements to Preserve

1. **Rate Limiting**: Continue to provide rate limiting as wrapper functions
2. **Data Redaction**: Continue to provide data redaction utilities
3. **Process Monitoring**: Continue to provide process monitoring where applicable
4. **Input Validation**: Continue to provide input validation utilities
5. **Error Handling**: Continue to provide enhanced error handling

The key is to use the official SDK for the core transport functionality while preserving our security enhancements as additional layers on top.
