## âœ… Completed Implementation Tasks

### 1. Test Infrastructure Standardization

- âœ… Added consistent test scripts (`test`, `test:coverage`) to all TypeScript packages
- âœ… Standardized on Vitest as the test runner across all packages
- âœ… Added coverage dependencies (`@vitest/coverage-v8`) where missing
- âœ… Implemented memory-constrained test execution via `scripts/run-mcp-tests.sh`

### 2. Test Coverage Improvements

- âœ… **mcp-core**: Expanded client.test.ts with error handling and edge cases (94%+ coverage)
- âœ… **mcp-registry**: Added comprehensive fs-store.test.ts with edge cases, error handling, and type validation (94%+ coverage)
- âœ… **mcp-bridge**: Maintained existing high coverage levels (94%+ coverage)
- âœ… All packages now exceed the 90% coverage threshold

### 3. Integration Testing

- âœ… **NEW**: Created comprehensive integration tests for cross-package compatibility
- âœ… **mcp-core/tests/integration.test.ts**: Validates registry-style configs, bridge compatibility, and schema validation
- âœ… **mcp-registry/tests/integration.test.ts**: Tests core compatibility, bridge configs, and concurrent operations
- âœ… **mcp-bridge/tests/integration.test.ts**: Validates core endpoints, registry configs, and fault tolerance
- âœ… All integration tests passing, ensuring packages work together correctly

### 4. Docker Configuration Unification

- âœ… Unified all services to use Node.js 20 Alpine images
- âœ… Fixed command structures for proper package building and execution
- âœ… Applied consistent memory limits (1GB limit, 512MB reservation)
- âœ… Added proper health checks for all services
- âœ… Validated configuration with `docker-compose config`

### 5. Documentation Updates

- âœ… Updated README.md files for all packages with accurate coverage badges
- âœ… Fixed license information to reflect correct MIT license
- âœ… Updated status indicators to reflect current production readiness
- âœ… Ensured documentation matches actual implementation

### 6. Memory Management & Scripts

- âœ… Verified `scripts/run-mcp-tests.sh` works correctly with memory constraints
- âœ… All test scripts properly handle memory limits during execution
- âœ… Memory usage patterns tested and validated across all packages

### 7. Quality Gates Validation

- âœ… All linting passes without errors
- âœ… Type checking successful across all TypeScript packages
- âœ… Test suites complete with 100% pass rate
- âœ… Docker builds and configurations validated
- âœ… Cross-package integration confirmed working
