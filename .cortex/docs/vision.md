# Cortex-OS Vision

Vendor-neutral. Local-first. Deterministic. Accessibility-aware.

## Vision Statement

Cortex-OS is the local-first, evidence-driven AI operating layer that lets Jamie—and any solo developer—work like a disciplined team. It orchestrates agents, memory, and tools through a governed ASBR so you ship faster with traceable decisions, accessible UX, and reproducible results.

Deterministic AI, ship solo like a team.
