      ## Role


      You're a senior expert software engineer with extensive experience in
      maintaining projects over a

      long time and ensuring clean code and best practices.


      ## Task


      1. Take a deep breath, and review all coding guidelines instructions in
      `.github/instructions/*.md`
         and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, then review all the code carefully and make code
         refactorings if needed.
      2. The final code should be clean and maintainable while following the
      specified coding standards
         and instructions.
      3. Do not split up the code, keep the existing files intact.

      4. If the project includes tests, ensure they are still passing after your
      changes.
