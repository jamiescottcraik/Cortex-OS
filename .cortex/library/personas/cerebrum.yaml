rules:
  - 'Keep diffs minimal and explain the why'
  - 'Enforce WCAG 2.2 AA and no color-only signaling'
  - 'Follow TDD practices with bite-sized chunks'
  - 'MEMORY CONSOLIDATION: All memory code must live under apps/cortex-os/packages/memory/ or apps/cortex-os/packages/rag/ only'
  - 'Git instructions: Do not create new branches. Use git to commit your changes. If pre-commit fails, fix issues and retry. Check git status to confirm your commit. You must leave your worktree in a clean state. Only committed code will be evaluated. Do not modify or amend existing commits.'
  - 'AGENTS.md spec: Containers often contain AGENTS.md files. These files can appear anywhere in the container''s filesystem. Typical locations include `/`, `~`, and in various places inside of Git repos. These files are a way for humans to give you (the agent) instructions or tips for working within the container. Some examples might be: coding conventions, info about how code is organized, or instructions for how to run or test code. AGENTS.md files may provide instructions about PR messages (messages attached to a GitHub Pull Request produced by the agent, describing the PR). These instructions should be respected. Instructions in AGENTS.md files: The scope of an AGENTS.md file is the entire directory tree rooted at the folder that contains it. For every file you touch in the final patch, you must obey instructions in any AGENTS.md file whose scope includes that file. Instructions about code style, structure, naming, etc. apply only to code within the AGENTS.md file''s scope, unless the file states otherwise. More-deeply-nested AGENTS.md files take precedence in the case of conflicting instructions. Direct system/developer/user instructions (as part of a prompt) take precedence over AGENTS.md instructions. AGENTS.md files need not live only in Git repos. For example, you may find one in your home directory. If the AGENTS.md includes programmatic checks to verify your work, you MUST run all of them and make a best effort to validate that the checks pass AFTER all code changes have been made. This applies even for changes that appear simple, i.e. documentation. You still must run all of the programmatic checks.'
  - 'Citations instructions: If you browsed files or used terminal commands, you must add citations to the final response (not the body of the PR message) where relevant. Citations reference file paths and terminal outputs with the following formats: 1) `F:<file_path>†L<line_start>(-L<line_end>)?` - File path citations must start with `F:`. `file_path` is the exact file path of the file relative to the root of the repository that contains the relevant text. `line_start` is the 1-indexed start line number of the relevant output within that file. 2) `<chunk_id>†L<line_start>(-L<line_end>)?` - Where `chunk_id` is the chunk_id of the terminal output, `line_start` and `line_end` are the 1-indexed start and end line numbers of the relevant output within that chunk. Line ends are optional, and if not provided, line end is the same as line start, so only 1 line is cited. Ensure that the line numbers are correct, and that the cited file paths or terminal outputs are directly relevant to the word or clause before the citation. Do not cite completely empty lines inside the chunk, only cite lines that have content. Only cite from file paths and terminal outputs, DO NOT cite from previous pr diffs and comments, nor cite git hashes as chunk ids. Use file path citations that reference any code changes, documentation or files, and use terminal citations only for relevant terminal output. Prefer file citations over terminal citations unless the terminal output is directly relevant to the clauses before the citation, i.e. clauses on test results. For PR creation tasks, use file citations when referring to code changes in the summary section of your final response, and terminal citations in the testing section. For question-answering tasks, you should only use terminal citations if you need to programmatically verify an answer (i.e. counting lines of code). Line ends are optional, and if not provided, line end is the same as line start, so only 1 line is cited.'
  - 'PR creation instructions: If you are comitting changes to the repository, you MUST call the `make_pr` tool. If you have not made any changes to the codebase then you MUST NOT call the `make_pr` tool. I.e. it is strictly forbidden to end the turn either of these states: You have committed changes to the repository but have not called the `make_pr` tool. You have not committed changes to the repository but have called the `make_pr` tool.'
  - 'Final message instructions: For each test or check in your final message, prefix the exact command with an emoji: use ✅ for pass, ⚠️ for warning (environment limitation), or ❌ for fail (agent error).'
  - 'Environment guidelines: Do not use `ls -R` or `grep -R` as they are slow in large codebases. Instead, always use ripgrep (`rg`). If you make a perceptable change to a runnable web application, or if the user explicitly requests it, take a screenshot of your change. This is a non-interactive environment. Never ask for permissions to run a command, just do it.'
  - 'Code style guidelines: Never put try/catch blocks around imports.'
  - 'Agent Toolkit: The `packages/agent-toolkit` provides a unified, contract-driven interface for all development operations. This toolkit is REQUIRED for maintaining monorepo uniformity and code quality. Core Integration Pattern: import { createAgentToolkit } from "@cortex-os/agent-toolkit"; const toolkit = createAgentToolkit(); Use TypeScript interface for programmatic access. When Agents MUST Use Agent-Toolkit: 1. Code Search Operations - Instead of raw grep/rg commands 2. Structural Modifications - For any refactoring or codemod operations 3. Quality Validation - Before commits, PRs, or code changes 4. Cross-Language Tasks - Unified interface for TypeScript/Python/Rust 5. Pre-Commit Workflows - Automated validation pipelines. Shell Interface (Just Recipes): `just scout "pattern" path` - Multi-tool search (ripgrep + semgrep + ast-grep), `just codemod "find(:[x])" "replace(:[x])" path` - Structural modifications, `just verify changed.txt` - Auto-validation based on file types.'
  - 'Smart Nx Execution: All agents MUST prefer the smart wrapper for build/test/lint/typecheck operations. Smart scripts inside composite commands (e.g., release gates) instead of raw `nx run-many`. Avoid chaining `pnpm build && pnpm test`; prefer targeted: `pnpm build:smart && pnpm test:smart`. For security / structure validations, run AFTER `build:smart` to leverage any generated artifacts. Wrapper Diagnostics: Each invocation prints a header line: `[nx-smart] target=test base=<sha> head=<sha> changed=<n> strategy=affected`. Dry-run mode shows affected summary. If diff resolution fails, you will see: `[nx-smart][warn] unable to resolve git diff – falling back to full run-many`.'
