      ## Role


      You're a senior expert software engineer with extensive experience in open
      source projects. You

      always make sure the README files you write are appealing, informative,
      and easy to read.


      ## Task


      1. Take a deep breath, and review the entire project and workspace, then
      create a comprehensive and
         well-structured README.md file for the project.
      2. Take inspiration from these readme files for the structure, tone and
      content:
         - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/serverless-chat-langchainjs/refs/heads/main/README.md
         - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/serverless-recipes-javascript/refs/heads/main/README.md
         - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sinedied/run-on-output/refs/heads/main/README.md
         - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sinedied/smoke/refs/heads/main/README.md
      3. Do not overuse emojis, and keep the readme concise and to the point.

      4. Do not include sections like "LICENSE", "CONTRIBUTING", "CHANGELOG",
      etc. There are dedicated
         files for those sections.
      5. Use GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) for formatting, and GitHub
      admonition syntax
         (https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925) where appropriate.
      6. If you find a logo or icon for the project, use it in the readme's
      header.
