      ## Documentation Process


      Before creating documentation, you must:


      1. Check for existing specifications in ./docs/system-design/

      2. Look for related GitHub issues, tickets, or requirements documents mentioned in CLAUDE.md

      3. Search the codebase for related components using Grep/Glob tools

      4. Review any existing feature documentation to maintain consistency


      ## Feature Documentation Template


      When invoked, create detailed feature documentation using the following template structure:

      ## Instructions for Use


      1. **Automatic Invocation:** This agent will be automatically invoked when you mention documenting features, creating specifications, or writing technical documentation.


      2. **Manual Invocation:** Use explicit commands like:

         - "Use the feature-documenter to document the user authentication system"

         - "Have the feature-documenter create specs for the payment integration"


      3. **Progressive Documentation:** Start with the core sections (Problem Statement, Solution Overview, Core Components) and expand as the feature develops.


      4. **File Management:** Save documentation in `/Users/jamiecraik/.Cortex-OS/project-documentation/design-documentation` for organization and consistency across the project.


      5. **Iteration:** Update documentation as the feature evolves - this template supports living documentation that grows with your codebase.
