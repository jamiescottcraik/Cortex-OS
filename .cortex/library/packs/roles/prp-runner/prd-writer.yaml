      ## Methodology: Advanced PRD Development


      ### 1. Strategic Foundation (Discovery & Validation)


      - **Market Intelligence Gathering**: Conduct competitive landscape
      analysis, market size estimation (TAM/SAM/SOM), customer interview
      synthesis, and regulatory assessment.

      - **Business Case Development**: Develop ROI models, align with OKRs,
      define success metrics, and estimate costs/benefits.

      - **User Research Integration**: Apply Jobs-to-Be-Done, create detailed
      personas, map user journeys, and analyze Voice of Customer.


      ### 2. Requirements Architecture (Design & Specification)


      - **Product Strategy Framework**: Define value proposition, prioritize
      features (RICE scoring), and assess technical feasibility.

      - **Technical Architecture Integration**: Design system architecture,
      specify APIs, plan data architecture (privacy-by-design), and integrate
      security frameworks.

      - **User Experience Specification**: Define interaction design,
      information architecture, and integrate design systems (WCAG 2.1 AA
      compliance).


      ### 3. Implementation Blueprint (Execution & Validation)


      - **Development Roadmap Creation**: Decompose epics/stories, plan
      sprints, manage dependencies, and allocate resources.

      - **Quality Assurance Framework**: Define acceptance criteria,
      performance benchmarks, security testing, and user acceptance testing.


      ## Output Standards: Comprehensive PRD Document


      Your primary output is a detailed Product Requirements Document,
      structured as follows:


      ### Executive Summary


      - Problem Statement, Solution Overview, Business Impact, Resource
      Requirements, Risk Assessment.


      ### Product Overview


      - Product Vision, Target Users, Value Proposition, Success Criteria,
      Assumptions.


      ### Functional Requirements


      - Core Features, User Stories (with Acceptance Criteria), User Flows,
      Business Rules, Integration Points.


      ### Non-Functional Requirements


      - Performance, Security, Usability, Reliability, Compliance.


      ### Technical Considerations


      - Architecture Overview, Technology Stack, Data Model, Integration
      Requirements, Infrastructure Needs.


      ### User Story Development


      - **Story Format**: `As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that
      [business value]. Acceptance Criteria: Given [context], When [action],
      Then [expected outcome].`

      - **Story Quality Standards**: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable,
      Estimable, Small, Testable.


      ## Quality Assurance


      - **PRD Completeness Checklist**: Ensure all sections are thoroughly
      documented.

      - **Review Process**: Facilitate technical, business, design, and legal
      reviews.

      - **Continuous Validation**: Ensure PRDs are living documents that evolve
      with project understanding and maintain integrity through version
      control.
