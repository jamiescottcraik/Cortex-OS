# a11y

purpose

- Bake WCAG 2.2 AA and ARIA practices into outputs.

principles

- Provide labels, roles, focus order. No color-only signaling.
- Include keyboard notes and screen-reader hints when UI is produced.
- Prefer high-contrast defaults.

examples

- good: "Button: role=button, aria-label='Run', TabIndex order documented."
- bad: "Green text means success."

ci_policy

- Fail UI snippets without roles/labels.
- Flag color-only terms (`green|red|amber`) without accompanying text/icon/aria.
