## ðŸ”„ Agentic Coding Workflow for Claude

Claude agents must follow the 4-phase structured workflow defined in AGENTS.md:

### 0. Tasks - Use semantic task ID slugs, store context in ~/tasks and local memory

### 1. Research - Semantic search + web research â†’ [feature].research.md

### 2. Planning - TDD plan with software engineering principles â†’ [feature]-tdd-plan.md

### 3. Implementation - Execute plan with brAInwav standards and 100% deployable code

### 4. Verification - Comprehensive testing and quality gates, update status to "verified"

See main CLAUDE.md file in repository root for detailed workflow implementation.

## Agent Toolkit

Use `agent-toolkit/tools` wrappers for search, codemods, diff review and validation.
