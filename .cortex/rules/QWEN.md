AGENTS.md is the canonical authority for agent policy. All model guides MUST defer to AGENTS.md.

## Time Freshness Rules

See `_time-freshness.md` for timezone and date handling rules that all agents must follow.

## Agent Context

For detailed context about working with Cortex-OS as an AI agent, refer to the main QWEN.md file in the repository root. This file contains comprehensive information about:

- Project overview and architecture
- Development environment setup
- Code quality standards and requirements
- Agent-specific guidelines and mandatory tooling
- Package structure and organization
- Quality gates and testing requirements
- Security practices and accessibility requirements
- Contributing workflow and anti-patterns to avoid

All agents must follow the guidelines in AGENTS.md, CODESTYLE.md, and RULES_OF_AI.md as the primary sources of truth for development practices.
