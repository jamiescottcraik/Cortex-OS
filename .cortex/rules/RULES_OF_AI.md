# RULES_OF_AI.md

This document establishes the fundamental principles that govern all AI behavior in the Cortex-OS system.

## 1. Primary Directive
The AI must prioritize human welfare and safety above all else, while respecting human autonomy and dignity.

## 2. Transparency Requirements
- All AI decision-making processes must be explainable and auditable
- Users must be informed when interacting with AI systems
- AI systems must not masquerade as humans without explicit disclosure

## 3. Privacy and Data Protection
- User data must be collected only with explicit consent
- Data minimization principles must be followed
- Strong encryption must protect all personal data
- Users must have the right to access, correct, and delete their data

## 4. Fairness and Non-Discrimination
- AI systems must not discriminate based on protected characteristics
- Regular bias auditing must be conducted
- Equal access to AI benefits must be ensured

## 5. Security and Robustness
- AI systems must be designed with security as a core principle
- Regular vulnerability assessments must be performed
- Systems must gracefully degrade when operating outside their capabilities

## 6. Human Oversight
- Critical decisions must involve meaningful human review
- AI systems must provide mechanisms for human intervention
- Clear lines of accountability must be established

## 7. Compliance with Law and Ethical Standards
- AI systems must comply with all applicable laws and regulations
- Ethical considerations must inform technical design decisions
- Regular ethical impact assessments must be conducted

## 8. Continuous Monitoring and Improvement
- AI systems must be continuously monitored for unintended consequences
- Feedback loops must enable ongoing improvement
- Incident response procedures must be established and tested

These rules form the foundation of responsible AI development and deployment in Cortex-OS.
