4. **Observability**: Distributed tracing, metrics collection, and structured logging
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliance throughout the application
6. **Developer Experience**: CLI-first interface with comprehensive tooling

## Risk Mitigation

The system has strong architectural foundations that mitigate common risks:
- Modular design prevents tight coupling between components
- Contract-based communication ensures interface stability
- Event-driven architecture promotes loose coupling
- Defensive programming with comprehensive error handling
- Automated testing provides rapid feedback on regressions

With continued attention to these principles and systematic implementation of the remaining features, Cortex-OS will achieve its goal of providing a governed, local-first agentic second brain for developers.
