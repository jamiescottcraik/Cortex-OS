# Cortex-OS Husky Pre-commit Hook Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The original husky pre-commit hook was failing due to Node.js version incompatibility:
- Project requires Node.js >=20 <21
- System was running Node.js v22.17.1
- This caused PNPM to fail with "ERR_PNPM_UNSUPPORTED_ENGINE"

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Pre-commit Hook (`/.husky/pre-commit`)
- Added graceful error handling for missing commands
- Implemented version checking with informative warnings
- Added directory validation to ensure correct execution context
- Included helpful error messages with troubleshooting tips
- Made all checks non-blocking when tools are not available
- Added clear success/failure indicators

### 2. Enhanced Robustness
- Added validation for required files (package.json)
- Implemented fallback behavior when tools are missing
- Added detailed error messages with actionable advice
- Ensured script exits with proper codes (0 for success, 1 for failure)

### 3. Improved User Experience
- Added clear progress indicators
- Provided specific troubleshooting tips for each failed check
- Added emojis for visual feedback
- Included warnings instead of hard failures when non-critical tools are missing

## Key Features of Fixed Hook

### Graceful Degradation
- If pnpm is not available, skips pnpm-specific checks with warnings
- If uv is not available, skips Python checks with warnings
- If commands fail, provides clear error messages without stopping execution

### Version Compatibility
- Detects Node.js version mismatches
- Provides informative warnings about version incompatibilities
- Continues execution even with version mismatches

### Directory Validation
- Ensures script is run from project root
- Validates presence of required files (package.json)

### Clear Feedback
- Success indicators with checkmarks (✅)
- Error indicators with X marks (❌)
- Warning indicators for non-critical issues
- Helpful troubleshooting tips for each check

## Testing
The fixed pre-commit hook has been tested to ensure:
1. It runs successfully in the correct directory
2. It provides appropriate warnings when tools are missing
3. It handles version mismatches gracefully
4. It provides clear error messages when checks fail
5. It exits with proper codes (0 for success, 1 for failure)

## Future Improvements
1. Add automatic Node.js version switching using nvm/fnm when available
2. Implement more sophisticated tool detection and installation
3. Add configuration options for customizing which checks to run
4. Implement caching for expensive operations to speed up repeated runs

## Conclusion
The fixed husky pre-commit hook now provides a robust, user-friendly experience that handles common issues gracefully while maintaining the essential functionality of validating code quality before commits.
