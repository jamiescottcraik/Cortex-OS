- 100% dependency audit coverage
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- Compliance with OWASP ASVS and MITRE ATLAS

### Performance
- &lt;100ms median response time for API calls
- 99.9% uptime for core services
- &lt;500ms median response time for AI model calls
- Efficient resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk)

### Quality
- &gt;90% test coverage across all packages
- &lt;1% error rate in production
- &lt;24hr mean time to recovery (MTTR)
- Zero breaking changes in minor releases

### User Experience
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance across all interfaces
- &lt;3 second page load times
- 95% user satisfaction rating
- Comprehensive documentation coverage

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **MLX Performance Variability**: Implement fallback chains and performance monitoring
- **Scalability Challenges**: Design for horizontal scaling from the beginning
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Implement defense-in-depth security measures
- **Dependency Management**: Use lock files and regular dependency audits

### Organizational Risks
- **Resource Constraints**: Prioritize critical features and defer non-essential work
- **Knowledge Silos**: Implement pair programming and cross-training
- **Changing Requirements**: Use agile methodologies with frequent feedback cycles
- **Market Competition**: Focus on unique value propositions and differentiation

## Budget Considerations

### Infrastructure
- Cloud hosting costs for staging and production environments
- Development tools and licenses
- Monitoring and observability platform costs
- Security scanning and compliance tooling

### Personnel
- Engineering time for feature development and maintenance
- Security expertise for ongoing vulnerability management
- DevOps expertise for deployment and operations
- Documentation and technical writing resources

### Training & Development
- Conference attendance and professional development
- Online courses and certification programs
- Books and educational materials
- Workshops and hands-on training sessions

## Stakeholder Communication

### Regular Updates
- Weekly team standups
- Bi-weekly stakeholder demos
- Monthly board reporting
- Quarterly strategic reviews

### Escalation Procedures
- Technical blockers → Engineering Lead within 24 hours
- Security incidents → Security Team immediately
- Performance degradation → Operations Team immediately
- Customer issues → Support Team within 1 hour

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to advancing Cortex-OS toward production readiness while maintaining focus on security, performance, and user experience. The quarterly breakdown allows for regular reassessment and reprioritization based on evolving requirements and market conditions.
