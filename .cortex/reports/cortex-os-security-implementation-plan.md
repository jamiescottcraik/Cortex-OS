# Cortex-OS Security Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive security implementation plan for Cortex-OS, addressing the system's security posture across all components and layers. The plan follows industry best practices including OWASP ASVS, MITRE ATLAS, and NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

## Security Principles

### Core Tenets
1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary permissions for all components
3. **Fail Secure**: Secure default configurations and graceful failure modes
4. **Privacy by Design**: Data protection built into system architecture
5. **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify

### Security Domains
1. **Infrastructure Security**: Container isolation, network segmentation
2. **Application Security**: Input validation, secure coding practices
3. **Data Security**: Encryption, access controls, data minimization
4. **Identity & Access Management**: Authentication, authorization, audit trails
5. **Supply Chain Security**: Dependency verification, SBOM generation

## Current Security Posture Assessment

### Strengths
- Strong input validation with Zod schemas
- Security scanning with LlamaGuard integration
- Policy enforcement at multiple layers
- Audit trails for all operations
- Local-first execution minimizing data exposure

### Gaps
- Incomplete security scanning pipeline
- Missing SBOM generation and dependency auditing
- Insufficient secret management and redaction
- Limited security policy enforcement
- Absence of comprehensive compliance reporting

### 2. SBOM Generation
```javascript
// scripts/generate-sbom.js
import { BomCreator } from '@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library';
import { writeFileSync } from 'fs';

async function generateSBOM() {
  const bom = new BomCreator();
  
  // Add components from package.json
  const pkg = JSON.parse(readFileSync('package.json', 'utf8'));
  bom.addComponent({
    name: pkg.name,
    version: pkg.version,
    type: 'application',
    // Add dependencies
    dependencies: Object.entries(pkg.dependencies).map(([name, version]) => ({
      name,
      version,
      type: 'library'
    }))
  });

  // Generate and write SBOM
  const xml = bom.toJSON();
  writeFileSync('sbom.xml', xml);
}
```

// libs/security/secret-manager.ts
import Vault from 'node-vault';

class SecretManager {
  private vault: Vault;

  constructor() {
    this.vault = Vault({
      endpoint: process.env.VAULT_ADDR,
      token: process.env.VAULT_TOKEN
    });
  }

  async getSecret(path: string): Promise<string> {
    try {
      const result = await this.vault.read(path);
      return result.data.value;
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to retrieve secret: ${error.message}`);
    }
  }

  redact(text: string): string {
    // Redact common secret patterns
    return text
      .replace(/\b[A-Za-z0-9_/+\-.]{32,}\b/g, '[REDACTED]')

// packages/security/auth-middleware.ts
import { verifyToken } from './jwt-verifier';
import { authorize } from './rbac';

export async function authMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  try {
    // Extract and verify JWT token
    const token = extractToken(req);
    const decoded = await verifyToken(token);
    
    // Check RBAC permissions
    const hasPermission = await authorize(
      decoded.userId,
      req.method,
      req.path
    );
    
    if (!hasPermission) {
      return res.status(403).json({
        error: 'Forbidden',
        message: 'Insufficient permissions'
      });
    }
    
    req.user = decoded;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(401).json({
