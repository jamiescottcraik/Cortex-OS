# Configuration

The toolkit relies on environment variables when optional behavior is needed.

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `TS_LIB` | Path to tree-sitter compiled languages bundle |
| `TS_LANG` | Language name for tree-sitter queries |

Configuration files are not required; tools inherit repository settings such as ESLint and Ruff configs.
