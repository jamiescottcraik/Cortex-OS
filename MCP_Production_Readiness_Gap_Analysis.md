- Flexible transport architecture
- Strong TypeScript type safety

### Critical Needs

- A2A and orchestration integration for Cortex-OS compatibility
- Comprehensive test coverage to meet quality standards
- Enhanced monitoring and observability
- Complete transport bridge implementation

### Timeline to Production Readiness

With focused effort on critical blockers, the package could achieve production readiness in **8-10 weeks**, assuming:

- Dedicated development resources
- Priority focus on integration work
- Parallel development of testing infrastructure

### Recommendation

Proceed with production readiness work focusing on critical blockers first. The strong security foundation and architecture provide a solid base for completing the remaining implementation work.
