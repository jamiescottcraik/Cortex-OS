# Memory Systems Audit Report

**Date:** August 27, 2025  
**Auditor:** Codex Web - Memory Systems Auditor  
**Scope:** `./cortex-os-clean/packages/memories`  
**Focus Areas:** Stores, Adapters, Retention, Privacy

## Executive Summary

The Cortex OS memory system demonstrates a well-architected approach to memory management with clear separation of concerns between storage mechanisms and business logic. The system supports multiple storage backends (Qdrant for vector search, Neo4j for graph relationships, with Prisma/PostgreSQL and SQLite adapters) and implements basic privacy controls. However, several areas require enhancement to meet enterprise-grade security and compliance standards.

## System Architecture Overview

The memory system implements a hexagonal architecture with the following key components:

1. **Core Domain Models**:
   - `Memory` entity with rich metadata (provenance, policy, TTL)
   - Policy enforcement mechanisms for access control
   - Expiration handling via ISO duration format

2. **Storage Adapters**:
   - Qdrant for vector search operations
   - Neo4j for knowledge graph relationships
   - Prisma/PostgreSQL for relational persistence
   - SQLite placeholder (not implemented)
   - In-memory store for testing

3. **Privacy Controls**:
   - Basic PII redaction (email addresses only)
   - Access control policies (read/write permissions)

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Persistence Correctness

**Strengths:**
- Clear domain model with proper typing
- Round-trip persistence tests in place
- Support for multiple storage backends

**Concerns:**
- SQLite adapter is a stub with no implementation
- Prisma adapter implementation is minimal with no actual database connection handling
- Missing comprehensive persistence tests for failure scenarios

**Recommendations:**
- Implement the SQLite adapter for local development use cases
- Enhance Prisma adapter with proper error handling and connection management
- Add tests for persistence failure scenarios (connection failures, constraint violations)

### 2. Data Compaction

**Strengths:**
- Expiration mechanism implemented with `purgeExpired` methods
- Time-to-live (TTL) support using ISO 8601 duration format

**Concerns:**
- In-memory store doesn't implement purging
- Prisma store returns 0 for purge operations (no implementation)
- No automatic compaction jobs or scheduled cleanup

**Recommendations:**
- Implement purging functionality in all adapters
- Add scheduled job for automatic cleanup of expired memories
- Consider size-based compaction in addition to time-based expiration

### 3. TTL/Retention Management

**Strengths:**
- Proper implementation of TTL using ISO 8601 duration format
- Conversion utility from ISO duration to milliseconds
- Expiration checking with proper date handling

**Concerns:**
- No validation of TTL values at the API level
- Inconsistent implementation across adapters (some ignore purge requests)
- No mechanism for extending or modifying TTL after creation

**Recommendations:**
- Add TTL validation in the memory schema
- Implement consistent purge functionality across all adapters
- Add API endpoints for TTL extension/management

### 4. Encryption (At Rest/In Transit)

**Concerns:**
- No evidence of encryption at rest in any storage adapter
- No explicit handling of encryption keys or key management
- Transport security depends on underlying database configurations

**Recommendations:**
- Implement encryption at rest for all persistent stores
- Add key management system integration
- Ensure TLS/SSL for all database connections
- Consider field-level encryption for sensitive memory content

### 5. Access Controls and Privacy

**Strengths:**
- Basic access control policy implementation
- PII redaction for email addresses
- Policy enforcement at save and retrieval time

**Concerns:**
- PII redaction is extremely limited (only email addresses)
- No audit logging of memory access
- Default-deny policy is opt-in rather than default
- No data residency or geographic controls

**Recommendations:**
- Expand PII redaction to cover more sensitive data types (phone numbers, addresses, etc.)
- Implement comprehensive audit logging for all memory operations
- Make default-deny the default policy
- Add data residency controls and geographic restrictions

### 6. Access Logs and Monitoring

**Concerns:**
- Minimal logging implementation (`console.error` in logs.ts)
- No structured logging or audit trails
- Limited observability beyond basic OpenTelemetry spans

**Recommendations:**
- Implement structured logging for all memory operations
- Add audit trails for access, modification, and deletion
- Enhance OpenTelemetry instrumentation with custom metrics
- Add alerting for anomalous access patterns

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Existing Tests
- Basic round-trip persistence tests
- Load recall tests
- Privacy redaction tests
- Security policy enforcement tests

### Missing Test Coverage
- Data compaction and expiration tests
- Encryption and security tests
- Adapter-specific integration tests
- Failure scenario tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Cross-adapter consistency tests

## DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment) Checklist

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Lawful basis for processing | ⚠️ Partial | Default policies need strengthening |
| Data minimization | ✅ | PII redaction implemented |
| Storage limitation | ⚠️ Partial | TTL implemented but not consistently enforced |
| Integrity and confidentiality | ❌ | No encryption at rest |
| Accountability | ⚠️ Partial | Basic audit logging needed |
| Privacy by design | ⚠️ Partial | Some controls but needs enhancement |

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Lack of encryption at rest** - Sensitive memory data stored in plain text
2. **Inadequate PII redaction** - Only email addresses are redacted
3. **Inconsistent data purging** - Expired data may not be removed from all stores

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Weak access logging** - Limited audit trail for compliance purposes
2. **Incomplete adapter implementations** - SQLite and Prisma adapters are not fully functional
3. **Default permissive policies** - Opt-in security rather than default security

### Low Priority Risks
1. **Missing scheduled compaction** - Performance optimization opportunity
2. **Limited observability** - Basic OpenTelemetry instrumentation only

## Remediation Plan

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. Implement encryption at rest for all storage adapters
2. Expand PII redaction to cover common sensitive data patterns
3. Fix purge/compaction implementation in all adapters

### Short-term Improvements (Priority 2)
1. Implement comprehensive audit logging
2. Complete SQLite and Prisma adapter implementations
3. Add data residency controls
4. Make default-deny policy the standard

### Long-term Enhancements (Priority 3)
1. Add key management system integration
2. Implement field-level encryption
3. Add scheduled compaction jobs
4. Enhance observability with custom metrics
5. Add performance benchmarks

## Security Scorecard

| Category | Score (1-5) | Comments |
|----------|-------------|----------|

## Recommendations Summary

1. **Critical**: Implement encryption at rest for all storage mechanisms

5. **Medium**: Complete implementation of SQLite and Prisma adapters
6. **Low**: Add scheduled compaction jobs for performance optimization

## Conclusion

The Cortex OS memory system provides a solid foundation with a clean architectural approach. However, significant improvements are needed in security controls, particularly around encryption and privacy. Addressing the identified risks will bring the system to enterprise-grade security standards and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
