# Orchestration Audit Report

## Scope
Path: `packages/orchestration`
Focus areas: planners, schedulers, workflows.

## Check Results
| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| DAG correctness | ✅ Implemented `validateWorkflow` to ensure acyclic graphs | Uses depth‑first search over declarative steps |
| Idempotency | ⚠️ Manual management required | No built‑in protection against duplicate executions |
| Retry policies | ⚠️ Schema supports retry but executor missing | `retry` fields defined but not enforced |
| Cancellation | ❌ Not implemented | Active orchestrations lack abort hooks |
| Deadlines | ⚠️ Schema supports `timeoutMs`; execution logic absent | Tested delay handling with fake timers |
| Observability | ⚠️ Basic logging only | No OTEL spans per node |

## Test Additions
- `tests/workflow-validator.test.ts`: validates DAG and demonstrates fake‑time handling.

## Fix Plan
1. **Idempotency** – add workflow execution cache keyed by step ID.
2. **Retry** – implement exponential backoff using `retry` metadata.
3. **Cancellation** – expose abort signals and propagate to agents.
4. **Deadlines** – enforce `timeoutMs` and global budget limits.
5. **Observability** – emit OTEL spans for each node and aggregate metrics.

## Score
Overall readiness: **45/100**
