# Simlab Audit

## Summary

- Focused on scenario generators, agents-in-the-loop, and metrics.
- Added tests for snapshot, metrics contract, and deterministic runs.

## Checks

- **Reproducibility & Seed Controls**: deterministic seeds validated through tests; seeds recorded in `tests/simlab/run-manifest.json`.
- **Scenario DSL Validity**: Zod schema rejects invalid definitions.
- **Log Structuring**: runner returns structured transitions and recorder timestamps runs.
- **Metrics**: `summarize` outputs steps, totalReward, success as defined.

## Test Results

- `runner.unit.test.ts` verifies deterministic completion and identical runs.
- `scenario.snapshot.test.ts` captures canonical run snapshot.
- `metrics.contract.test.ts` confirms metrics contract and schema validation.

## Fix Plan

- Persist structured logs to durable storage.
- Expand metric suite (variance, error tracking).
- Propagate seeds across nested agents and environments.
- Automate run-manifest generation.

## Score

**8/10** â€“ core determinism and metrics contracts in place; logging and advanced metrics require improvement.

## Run Manifest

See `tests/simlab/run-manifest.json` for seeds and artifacts.
