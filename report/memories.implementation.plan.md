- No performance degradation >10%
- All existing tests pass with encryption enabled

### 2. Expand PII Redaction Capabilities

**Tasks:**

- Enhance `redactPII` function to cover additional PII types:
  - Phone numbers (various formats)
  - Credit card numbers
  - Social Security Numbers
  - Physical addresses
  - IP addresses
- Add configuration options for PII types to redact
- Add unit tests for all PII types
- Update documentation

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

**Success Criteria:**

**Success Criteria:**

- Memories can be tagged with geographic locations
- Policies enforce data residency requirements
- Configuration is flexible and secure

## Priority 3: Medium-Value Enhancements

### 7. Make Default-Deny Policy the Standard

**Tasks:**

- Change default policy from permissive to deny
- Update configuration to support new default
- Update documentation
- Add migration path for existing deployments

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

**Success Criteria:**

- Default policy is deny rather than allow
- Existing deployments can migrate smoothly
- Documentation is updated

### 8. Add Key Management System Integration

**Tasks:**

- Research key management solutions (HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS, etc.)
- Implement integration with chosen solution
- Add key rotation capabilities
- Add key access logging

**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 days

**Success Criteria:**

- Secure key management is implemented
- Keys can be rotated without service interruption
- Key access is logged and monitored

### 9. Implement Field-Level Encryption

**Tasks:**

- Design field-level encryption approach
- Implement encryption for sensitive fields
- Add key management for field-level encryption
- Update storage adapters

**Estimated Effort:** 5-6 days

**Success Criteria:**

- Sensitive fields are encrypted at rest
- Performance impact is minimal
- Key management is secure

## Priority 4: Optimization and Monitoring

### 10. Add Scheduled Compaction Jobs

**Tasks:**

- Design compaction job architecture
- Implement compaction scheduler
- Add compaction metrics
- Add configuration for compaction policies

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

**Success Criteria:**

- Compaction jobs run on schedule
- Metrics are collected for compaction operations
- Configuration is flexible

### 11. Enhance Observability with Custom Metrics

**Tasks:**

- Identify key metrics to collect
- Implement metric collection
- Add dashboards for memory operations
- Add alerting for anomalous patterns

**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 days

**Success Criteria:**

- Key metrics are collected and stored
- Dashboards provide visibility into memory operations
- Alerting is in place for anomalies

### 12. Add Performance Benchmarks

**Tasks:**
