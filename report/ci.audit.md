# CI/CD Audit Report

## Summary
- Examined workflows under `.github/workflows` for build, test, scan and release stages.
- Added enforcement so the release pipeline fails when SBOM or provenance artifacts are missing.

## Findings
### Build & Test
- No matrix builds; jobs run only on `ubuntu-latest`.
- Caching relies on `setup-node` defaults; no explicit cache keys.
- Coverage checked with `nyc`, but thresholds are advisory (`|| true`).
- Accessibility checks exist via `accessibility.yml` using axe.

### Security Scanning
- Semgrep scans configured (`security-scan.yml`, `security-test.yml`).
- CodeQL analysis **missing**.
- Gitleaks secret scanning **missing**.
- SBOM generation existed but did not fail if files were absent.
- Provenance attestation absent in release workflow.

### Release
- Release process now generates SBOM and SLSA provenance and verifies both.
- Missing SBOM or provenance now causes workflow failure.

## Recommendations / Fix Plan
1. Introduce matrix builds for Node versions and OS targets.
2. Define explicit cache keys to ensure reproducible caching.
3. Add CodeQL workflow for static analysis.
4. Integrate gitleaks for secret scanning.
5. Enforce coverage thresholds and remove `|| true` bypasses.
6. Configure branch protection to require critical jobs (CI, security scans, SBOM, release).

## Score
- **Current compliance:** 60/100
- **Potential after fixes:** 90/100
