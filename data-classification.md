# Data Classification

We classify memory data into three categories:

- **Public**: Non-sensitive information safe for open sharing.
- **Internal**: Operational data restricted to authenticated team members.
- **Confidential**: Default level for memories containing user content or PII.

Confidential memories must be encrypted at rest and in transit and tagged with policy labels. Access is limited by tenant, agent, and declared purpose.
