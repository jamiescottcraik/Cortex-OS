# October 2, 2025 Baseline Notes

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` failed: pnpm-lock.yaml is stale relative to apps/cortex-webui/backend/package.json (sharp + @types/sharp additions).
- `uv sync` executed in `apps/cortex-py` and updated 19 Python packages (ruff 0.13.1, fastapi 0.117.1, transformers 4.56.2, etc.).
- `uv sync` from repo root failed: no top-level `pyproject.toml`.
- `just scout "quality_gate" scripts/ci` failed: `just` command not available in PATH.
- Scheduling actions (DevOps/TDD Coach availability) remain outstanding and require human follow-up.
