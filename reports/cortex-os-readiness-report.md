# Cortex-OS Readiness Report
## 1. Executive Summary
Cortex-OS requires significant remediation before production release. Tests cannot run under the current Node 20 environment, security scans reveal multiple leaked secrets, and accessibility artifacts are incomplete.

## 2. Traffic Light Scores
| Area | Score | R/A/G | Evidence |
|---|---:|:---:|---|
| Architecture & Boundaries | 70 | Amber | `.cortex/structure-guard.yaml` lines 1-5; `.github/CODEOWNERS` lines 1-20 |
| Code Quality & Maintainability | 65 | Amber | `package.json` lines 77-78 |
| API & Contracts | 60 | Amber | `schemas/log-event.schema.json` lines 1-19 |
| Security & Compliance | 40 | Red | `SECURITY.md` lines 1-16; gitleaks detect (65 leaks) |
| Testing & Coverage | 30 | Red | `package.json` lines 23-45; `pnpm nx:test:core` failed (Node 20) |
| CI/CD & Release | 55 | Red | `package.json` lines 106-112 |
| Runtime & Observability | 50 | Red | `infra/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml` lines 2-38 |
| Performance & SLOs | 45 | Red | no load/latency evidence |
| Accessibility & DX | 50 | Red | `package.json` lines 37-40; missing `a11y/wcag-roadmap.md` |
| Operational Readiness | 40 | Red | `infra/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml` lines 2-38 |

## 3. Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Node 20 environment blocks tests and coverage | High | Upgrade CI/runtime to Node >=22 |
| 65 potential secret leaks | Critical | Review and rotate affected credentials; configure gitleaks in CI |
| Missing accessibility roadmap | Medium | Add WCAG 2.2 AA plan and run `test:a11y` in CI |
| Insufficient coverage (<95%) | High | Implement unit and integration tests, enforce `test:coverage:threshold` |

## 4. Backward-Compatibility Removals
No removals proposed.

## 5. Backlog
1. Implement deterministic builds and provenance checks.
2. Add observability dashboards and structured logs.
3. Document rollback and failover procedures.
