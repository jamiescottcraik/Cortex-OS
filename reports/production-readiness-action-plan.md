# Production Readiness Action Plan (TDD-first)This plan drives each package to 95-100% across Testing, Reliability, Security, Architecture, Docs, and Accessibility using strict TDD and engineering principles.## Quality gates (global, enforced)- Test coverage: statements/branch/functions/lines >= 95% per package; target 100% where feasible- Lint/typecheck: zero errors; warnings fail CI for changed files- Static analysis: ESLint, Knip, TS config strict; Python: ruff/mypy- Security: `pnpm audit` (or `npm audit --omit=dev` parity) clean; `semgrep` and secret scan zero findings; SBOM present- Commit hygiene: conventional commits; commitlint + semantic-release dry run in CI- Docs: README per package includes quickstart, API surface, config, examples- a11y: Playwright a11y checks for web surfaces; axe minimum WCAG AA on critical paths- Build reproducibility: lockfiles up to date; pinned Docker images where used## TDD workflow (applies to every change)1. Write failing unit tests (Vitest/Jest in TS; PyTest in Python) for the behavior2. Implement the minimal code to pass tests3. Refactor with characterization tests for legacy paths4. Add integration tests using contracts in `libs/typescript/contracts` and A2A events5. Ensure mocks/stubs follow DI boundaries (no cross-feature imports; use broker interfaces)6. Update package README and examples## Packages and priority focusPrioritize lowest scoring packages first while unblocking critical path runtimes: `mvp`, `mvp-server`, `prp-runner`, `simlab-mono`, `memories`, `asbr`.For each package, apply the checklist below and raise scores to 95%+.### Per-package TDD checklist template- Tests - [ ] Unit tests cover all public functions/classes - [ ] Contract tests for A2A messages (publish/subscribe) with zod schemas - [ ] Integration tests for DI wiring in ASBR runtime (where applicable) - [ ] Error paths and edge cases (timeouts, retries, invalid input) - [ ] Coverage >= 95% statements/branches/functions/lines- Reliability - [ ] Idempotency/retry policies defined (exponential backoff) - [ ] Deterministic seeds for non-deterministic logic - [ ] Resource caps: timeouts, memory, concurrency - [ ] Logging with correlation IDs- Security - [ ] Input validation with Zod; output typed - [ ] No secrets in repo; dotenv schema validation - [ ] Least privilege for tool integrations (MCP) - [ ] Semgrep and dependency audit clean- Architecture - [ ] ESM only, boundary-safe imports - [ ] Interfaces in `libs/typescript/contracts`; utils from `libs/typescript/utils` - [ ] No cross-feature imports; use A2A or service interfaces via DI- Documentation - [ ] README with quickstart, API, config, examples - [ ] CHANGELOG updated by semantic-release- Accessibility (web UIs only) - [ ] Playwright a11y tests for critical flows - [ ] Axe rule violations addressed or waived with rationale## Concrete tasks by domain1. Testing and coverage - Create per-package `vitest.config.ts` inheriting from workspace; add `test:pkg` targets - Add boundary tests for A2A broker publish/subscribe using fake broker - Contract enforcements with zod: schema.parse in tests on emitted events - Add Playwright tests in `apps/cortex-web` for a11y2. Reliability - Introduce `p-retry` wrappers and circuit breakers for external calls (MCP manager) - Add timeouts with `AbortController` and test cancellations3. Security - Add `semgrep` ruleset and CI step; fix findings - Validate env via `zod` schema per package; fail fast tests for missing vars - Generate SBOM with `pnpm sbom` or `cyclonedx-npm` and store in `sbom/`4. Architecture - Move contracts to `libs/typescript/contracts` when found local - Replace direct imports with A2A messages or DI service interfaces5. Docs - Add `README.md` skeletons where missing - Wire `docs/LAUNCH.md` and package quickstarts## Success criteria- All targeted packages at or above 95% coverage and passing gates- CI shows zero high/critical vulnerabilities, zero secret leaks, and green a11y checks- Unified launch doc verified end-to-end locally## Implementation cadence- Week 1: mvp, mvp-server, prp-runner- Week 2: asbr, memories, simlab-mono- Week 3: a2a, mcp-bridge, registry- Week 4: long-tail packages and polish---Refer to `docs/LAUNCH.md` for runbooks and how to execute coverage and checks.

## Quick launch checklist (local + CI parity)

- pnpm install
- pnpm build
- pnpm test
- pnpm test:coverage
- pnpm pw:test # accessibility checks
- pnpm ci:governance # repo-wide governance parity (lint, audits, etc.)
- Python: uv sync; uv run pytest (where applicable)
