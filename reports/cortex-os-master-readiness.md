## Area Breakdowns

### Production – 65 (Amber)

- Modular architecture and strict boundaries documented
- Test coverage could not be verified; vitest binaries missing

### Governance – 90 (Green)

- Structure guard, security policy, license, and CODEOWNERS in place

### Resilience – 55 (Red)

- Basic chaos script exists; no documented runbooks or MTTR metrics

### Accessibility – 70 (Amber)

## Risk Register

| ID  | Area          | Severity | Risk                                        | Mitigation                                 |
| --- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| R1  | Resilience    | High     | Chaos testing limited to malformed requests | Add CPU/memory/network fault experiments   |
| R2  | Production    | Medium   | Coverage tooling missing                    | Restore test dependencies and run coverage |
| R3  | Accessibility | Medium   | A11y tests not run in CI                    | Enable `pnpm test:a11y` in pipeline        |
| R4  | Investor      | High     | No monetization or ARR plan                 | Draft business model and pricing hooks     |

## Investor Narrative

Cortex-OS aims to deliver an accessible, modular agent runtime with an Open WebUI-style chat interface and tool ecosystem. Differentiators include strict contract boundaries, privacy-first design, and MLX-first model strategy with Ollama fallbacks. To attract investment, the project must quantify total addressable market, articulate pricing for the marketplace, and outline a path to recurring revenue.
