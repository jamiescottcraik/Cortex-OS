# Memory Systems Audit - Summary of Work Completed

## Overview

This document summarizes the work completed as part of the Memory Systems Audit, including the audit report, implementation of new tests, and enhancements to the privacy redaction functionality.

## Audit Report

The comprehensive audit report (`report/memories.audit.md`) was created, analyzing the memory systems across several key areas:

1. **Persistence Correctness** - Evaluated round-trip persistence and adapter implementations
2. **Data Compaction** - Reviewed expiration mechanisms and purge functionality
3. **TTL/Retention Management** - Analyzed time-to-live handling and expiration policies
4. **Encryption** - Identified lack of encryption at rest as a critical issue
5. **Access Controls and Privacy** - Found limited PII redaction capabilities
6. **Access Logs and Monitoring** - Noted minimal logging implementation

The audit resulted in a security score of 2.4/5, with recommendations for improvement across all areas.

## Implementation Plan

A detailed implementation plan (`report/memories.implementation.plan.md`) was created to address the audit findings, organized by priority:

1. **Priority 1 (Critical)**: Encryption at rest, expanded PII redaction, data purging
2. **Priority 2 (High)**: Audit logging, adapter completion, data residency controls
3. **Priority 3 (Medium)**: Key management, field-level encryption, default-deny policies
4. **Priority 4 (Low)**: Compaction jobs, enhanced observability, performance benchmarks

## New Tests Implemented

Five new test files were created to improve test coverage:

1. **`tests/persistence.prisma.roundtrip.spec.ts`** - Tests for Prisma adapter persistence
2. **`tests/load-recall.enhanced.spec.ts`** - Enhanced load and recall tests
3. **`tests/privacy.redaction.enhanced.spec.ts`** - Expanded privacy redaction tests
4. **`tests/ttl.expiration.spec.ts`** - Tests for TTL and expiration handling
5. **`tests/compaction.spec.ts`** - Tests for data compaction and purging

All new tests are passing, increasing the test coverage for the memory systems.

## Privacy Redaction Enhancements

The `redactPII` function was significantly enhanced to handle multiple types of PII:

1. **Email addresses** (existing functionality)
2. **Phone numbers** (new) - Multiple formats including (555) 123-4567, 555-123-4567, +1-555-123-4567
3. **Credit card numbers** (new) - 16-digit numbers in various formats
4. **Social Security Numbers** (new) - Patterns like 123-45-6789
5. **Physical addresses** (new) - Street addresses with common street types

The enhanced regex patterns properly handle word boundaries and special characters to avoid over-redaction while ensuring comprehensive PII protection.

## Test Results

All new tests are passing:

- 4 tests in `privacy.redaction.enhanced.spec.ts`
- 2 tests in `persistence.prisma.roundtrip.spec.ts`
- 3 tests in `load-recall.enhanced.spec.ts`
- 2 tests in `compaction.spec.ts`
- 3 tests in `ttl.expiration.spec.ts`

Total: 14 new tests passing

## Next Steps

Based on the audit findings and implementation plan, the next steps should focus on:

1. **Implementing encryption at rest** for all storage adapters
2. **Completing the SQLite and Prisma adapter implementations**
3. **Adding comprehensive audit logging**
4. **Implementing scheduled compaction jobs**
5. **Adding key management system integration**

These steps will significantly improve the security and compliance posture of the memory systems.
