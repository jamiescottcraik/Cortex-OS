# brAInwav Operational Readiness Examples

This directory contains example implementations showing how to meet the 20 operational readiness criteria for brAInwav production standards.

## Examples Included

### Infrastructure & Health (1-4)

- [`health-endpoints.ts`](./health-endpoints.ts) - Kubernetes-compatible health endpoints
- [`environment-config.ts`](./environment-config.ts) - Environment configuration with validation
- [`secrets-management.ts`](./secrets-management.ts) - Secure secrets handling
- [`network-timeouts.ts`](./network-timeouts.ts) - Network timeout implementation

### Resilience & Reliability (5-8)

- [`retry-logic.ts`](./retry-logic.ts) - Retry with exponential backoff and circuit breaker
- [`idempotency.ts`](./idempotency.ts) - Idempotency key handling
- [`structured-logging.ts`](./structured-logging.ts) - brAInwav-branded structured logging
- [`metrics-collection.ts`](./metrics-collection.ts) - Prometheus metrics with RED/USE

### Observability & Operations (9-12)

- [`distributed-tracing.ts`](./distributed-tracing.ts) - OpenTelemetry tracing setup
- [`monitoring-setup.ts`](./monitoring-setup.ts) - Dashboards and alerts
- [`graceful-shutdown.ts`](./graceful-shutdown.ts) - SIGTERM handling and draining
- [`resource-monitoring.ts`](./resource-monitoring.ts) - Memory/CPU monitoring

### Deployment & Security (13-16)

- [`migration-testing.ts`](./migration-testing.ts) - Database migration patterns
- [`deployment-strategy.md`](./deployment-strategy.md) - Deployment and rollback procedures
- [`supply-chain-security.ts`](./supply-chain-security.ts) - SBOM and audit implementation
- [`fault-injection.ts`](./fault-injection.ts) - Chaos testing with Toxiproxy

### Environment & Process (17-20)

- [`environment-parity.md`](./environment-parity.md) - Staging ≈ prod setup
- [`operational-runbooks.md`](./operational-runbooks.md) - Incident response procedures
- [`data-privacy.ts`](./data-privacy.ts) - GDPR compliance patterns
- [`dependency-management.ts`](./dependency-management.ts) - Automated audit and updates

## Usage

Each example includes:

- ✅ **Working implementation** meeting brAInwav standards
- ✅ **Integration instructions** for your service
- ✅ **Testing approach** to validate the implementation
- ✅ **Monitoring and alerts** configuration
- ✅ **brAInwav branding** throughout

## Implementation Priority

Follow this order for maximum impact:

1. **Health endpoints** - Essential for deployment
2. **Graceful shutdown** - Critical for zero-downtime deployments
3. **Structured logging** - Needed for observability
4. **Environment configuration** - Foundation for all other features
5. **Continue with remaining criteria** based on your service needs

## brAInwav Standards

All examples maintain brAInwav branding in:

- System logs and error messages
- Metrics and monitoring labels
- Documentation and comments
- Configuration and deployment scripts
